Therefore, hypnotherapy can help some people stop certain behaviours, such as smoking or nail-biting. 2.

They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a persons character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brains biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.", "Intent: fact-9\nQuestion: Who does mental illness affect?\n\nResponse: It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficithyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24.

I dont show any other signs of als besides very little muscle twitching. I am doing some weird things to test myself through out the day. For example. Testing my WPM ( words per minute) that I can type. Which is 75 words per minute . (I do this to see if I have any weakness in my hands) I am standing on one foot to see if I can balance myself and shit like that. Also, tonight I just came home from dinner and I was holding a fork and I noticed it felt very odd in my hands. (It was a heavier than normal fork because it was at a steak house.) I also have health anxiety but I wish I knew I was okay. So I can stop worrying. I feel some pins and needles in my hands and light shooting pain in my arms and feet and thighs. Any help would be appreciated . Thank you.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Hey guys. Please check this out. My heart goes out to all of you experiencing this. It is crippling and mental torture when it gets out of hand and it feels like it has so much control over you. The world definitely puts enough things out there to scare us, but not enough to comfort us and assuage our fears. There is definitely a lack of balance and its so frustrating because mental health is SO important. Anxiety can make you feel like you are going crazy and to me, that is the scariest and most deeply troubling symptom. The feeling that I cant trust my mindmyself and that Ive lost who I am completely and Ill never be the same. Thats what fear and anxiety can do to you when not properly addressed! That being said, after WEEKS of constantly- and I mean CONSTANTLY- searching on google for self-help, I have FINALLY found a resource that is starting to help me. Most of the resources Ive found only scratch the surface and are really tailored to mild anxiety- they dont really help. I am only on the second module, but this is the most helpful source I have found for this illness and I am hopeful that I will get better. Please please pleaseeeee at least look at this. Give it a chance and open your mind to the possibility that you can be okay again.

My doctor asked me if I wanted it a few months ago, but I foolishly said no at the time because I was in a rush to leave. Boy, do I regret it now. I go back to college in about 2 weeks, and I am stressed. I suppose its not too late to go get it, but that doesnt quell my anxiety over the fact its only 10 effective anyway. Jeez. TLDR; Im afraid Im going to be one of those rare cases of someone dying of the flu. I need to stop reading. Im hoping for some solidarity here. Does anyone else have this fear, especially considering this season is supposedly very bad?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Hip still swollen 4 months after fall, anxiety about it hangs over me. About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didnt think it would be a good idea to get up immediately, but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night, but that was about it. The swelling started that night, too. Maybe a week and a half later, I went to the doctor about it. He didnt do any x-rays, but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didnt have any pain, and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall, and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am, 17 weeks later, and my hip is still swollen. There was a moment where it hurt for a bit about 2 months ago, but that was only for a week or two. The anxiety about it hangs over me.

Managed to tell myself that everything is alright and ignored all kind of twitchespains that were temporary that use to bring anxious people like me a lot of bad thoughts. Since around summer 2017 I started noticing small scars and little holes appearing on my face skin for no apparent reason. I have no acnee or other skin condition, I always had clear and clean skin. I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose, tested me for some anti-immune stuff which came out fine. Im trying to ignore it but every few days a new hole appears and its destroying my face a bit at a time. I think I will soon succumb to the thoughts and lose it again in front of health anxiety.

Ive always had normal periods. They always come every 28 days and last for 5. Not only that but Ive always been skinny, I havent had a bad acne breakout since I was 14, I dont get any facial hair aside from a little on my upper lip and I dont think its possible for me to have diabetes. But I gained 3 pounds this month. And my period started yesterday and then completely stopped. So now Im convinced I have it and I cant think about anything else. The last time PCOS fears struck me I had two panic attacks in a row and was a state of high stress for a while. My period ended up coming a week and a half early which just made the anxiety worse. Eventually everything went back to normal but for some reason Im convinced that wont happen this time.

This worry of ether a neurological disease or a serious infection such as Lyme seems to dominate most of my days. I constantly make the mistake of self diagnosing using discussion posts of users (on various sites) with similar issues and I realize its a recipe for unhappiness. This type of worry feels at times like an addiction that I simply cannot stop coming back to. I live an incredibly charmed life with an amazing family and incredible fianc\u00e9.

I mentioned it in passing to my husband who insisted I go to a doctor. Long story short, I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor. Very easy treatment and no major concerns with it. The twist is the medicine I take for it has a side effect of increasing anxiety. For me this has manifested into Health Anxieties and 99.9 of the time at night when Im trying to sleep.

Every time I eat something even mildly unhealthy (handful of salted peanuts, for example) I can feel the sodium and cholesterol in my chest, coursing through my veins around my heart.

Two in one year must be cancer. Shit lemme check my pulse again... Sore shoulders? Cancer from that sunburn I got 15 years ago probably. Slight cough? Definitely cancer from second hand smoke.

It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. Ive been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference.

The risk is like a 0,2 increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless its an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so thats why I didnt get an MRI. How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer.

Im 24 years old and before a little over a week ago, I thought I was in great health. A little over a week ago I started noticing heart palpitations (didnt know what it was called for a while) and chest pain. I thought this would just go away but it didnt after a couple of days. Then I had my first and second ever anxiety attacks. These were scary but I felt like I was anxious about my palpitations because they lasted all day and night. My pulse was constantly 20 bpm faster than it used to be, and the chest ache and pain lasted almost 24 hours. Ive seen doctors and nurses and Ive had a chest X-ray, blood work, and CT done and they didnt find anything abnormal. Ive been tracking my blood pressure as well and its constantly in the 15090 range and today (during a snow day) Ive been laying in bed and the pain and palpitations are feeling worse than ever and my BP was 160110 and my pulse 105. I had a Holter monitor and Im waiting to hear the results. I also started seeing a counselor. I dont consciously feel anxious, and my symptoms last all day and all night. Im waiting for my next doctors appointment but Im just reaching out because I feel worse day after day and just wanted to see if anyone else has been through something similar to this.

For the last 2 days Ive been having really big and sometimes debilitating pain in my abdomen area. It first started around the side of my abdomen kind of like a stitch, then throughout the day it slowly travelled to the middle just above my belly button. Last night the pain travelled down to my lower right which instantly got me worked up thinking of appendicitis. Phoned 111 and they recommended I go to the local Aamp;E. The blood test was fine and the doctor said he doesnt think its appendicitis. The problem is this pain has been so intense for the last 2 days and it doesnt seem to stop, just travel around my abdomen a bit, but is very intense in the lower right at the moment.

Background, so Ive been out at college since August, been to a couple of parties, and took up smoking, why, because it looks cool. There I admit it. I would say Ive been smoking since around Octber or November. I smoke maybe half a pack every other weekend, if that. Maybe have one or two on the side, here and there, but I wouldnt consider myself a smoker. Ive noticed a sore in my mouth, its all white, doesnt look harmful. I think its a canker sore, as Ive been drinking coffee like hell these past couple of weeks, sometimes without regard for how hot it is.

Im lucky in that I dont really worry about cats or dogs, since I next to never interact with them, but Im absolutely terrified of a rabid bat getting into my room and biting me without my knowing it. Weve had bats in our house twice now, and maybe two or three years ago, finally did an exclusion in our attic and had a professional go around and seal everything up. I havent slept with my window open at night for several years now, but last night, I left it open by mistake until around 4 in the morning; which, naturally, set off my anxiety. I have a screen on my window, which sort of sets against a little interior strip of wood, but it isnt tightly sealed, and theres one side thats actually quite loose (big enough that a bat probably could get through). Im trying to be very logical about this, but Im struggling. I was in my room basically all night until I went to bed (at around 4 AM), and never saw a bat, or heard anything against the screen, but just knowing that my window was open, and what if a bat got in while I wasnt looking or when I left the room or something? Reasonably, I know a sick bat wouldnt be able to get back out if one had gotten in, and I dont think theres any way I wouldnt notice a bat flying around -- healthy or otherwise! -- but its very hard to convince myself of that.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Freaking out about chipping a tooth I was eating a hamburger today and I felt a crack in the back of my mouth.

Ive also been having stomach pains like nausea for the past few days but Im not sure if im making up phantom nausea because Im worried I have a brain tumor. I also have had some on and off mild headaches but like I said above I could just be imagining it into existence.

They poked me, said these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests. So, I got bloodwork, a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started.

This can be found at the following link (my personal blog): http:www.kingofnowhere.cobloghealthanxiety Any comments  questions welcomed! Stay strong. If I can do this. You can too.

I do it most before bed and often wake up in the middle of the night scratching. I scratch when Im watching Netflix and anytime Im idle. I get the urge to scratch sometimes at work, but very rarely when Im busy or out having fun. Ive been tested for STIs and yeast and bacterial infections many times, its none of these things. The scratching problem also affects my anus but to a lesser extent. When I get the urge to scratch, its like a twitch that I cant ignore. Once I start scratching I find it very hard to stop. I feel relief when I scratch until I scratch so much that I tear the skin and it begins to hurt and bleed. When Im scratching I notice that Im usually holding my breath and my body is tense. My suspicion is that its an anxious behaviour and now that Ive suffered for over 4 years, its become an unconscious tick that I cant kick. I tried acupuncture and only experienced a mild improvement from 1 of my total 5 sessions. The improvement didnt last. Has anyone else suffered from this condition? Any and all advicepersonal stories would be so very appreciated.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Need some support this week! Hi friends! Long time reader, first time poster. Ive suffered from health anxiety for a few years now, and Im currently going through one of my worst bouts yet. Im getting a colonoscopy later this week because of some gastrointestinal issues (Im in my 20s), and my doctor has assured me multiple times he is not expecting colorectal cancer based on my symptoms. However, its all I can think about. I cant stop Googling my symptoms, finding people younger than me who were diagnosed with cancer, finding people with less symptoms than me finding out they had cancer, etc. Just looking for any advice to get through the next few days. Sending so much love to everyone who has to live like this.", "Health Anxiety Experience: ALS fears about tongue When I stick my tongue out as far as I can, one side is higher than the other in the very back. And also even when I try to completely rest my tongue, there are sporadic quivers of movement in certain spots. I made the mistake of googling this and am convinced that these must be tongue fasciculations from ALS, even though statistically I know that it is very rare in my age group. My speech isnt slurred and no problems eating or drinking or any other signs of weakness. Has anyone else freaked out about this before?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Chewed tobacco over the weekend. Anxiety going crazy Kinda like the title says, but I chewed tobacco this weekend. I was with a friend on vacation and while drunk, I packed a few dips. I dont normally chew, and the total times I have done it in my life are in the single digits. But I got a small canker sore from it, and it is driving my anxiety crazy thinking I have cancer. Lesson learned: Not worth doing it cause it will drive my anxiety crazy.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Colon cancer anxiety Hey all. Ive been losing my sleep worrying about this. Last week ive had bouts of diarrhea, they ocurred around the same time for 3 days or so. After that, ive had constipation, and im still suffering from it. I can pass stools with a lot of straining, but theyre really small, rabbit like (no blood). Also, last friday night i woke up very suddenly and threw up. That was the only time this happened though, and i had eaten out all day (a thing i dont usually do) but it still makes me worry. I should also add ive started taking Paxil again last tuesday after tapering off of it in January due to my anxiety. Ive read that it might cause some of the stuff im feeling, but i never had those the first time i took it, so i cant help but think i have cancer or something.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Tiny grain like feeling under foreskin 18 white male No meds Probably anxiety issues So Ive noticed that when Im erect I can feel this tiny little bump thing on the tip of my penis head. Im not circumcised and I feel like its under the skin, like on my head. It doesnt really feel like a bump though, it almost like a grain, or like a gash or cut kinda feeling. It feels like its almost inside the tip, I dont know. Ive felt it for about 2 weeks Ive looks up penile cancer and its apparently super rare, so I dont know...", "Health Anxiety Experience: Inhalated ACrefrigerant chemicals Today, I was in sitting in a lounge area of a building at my university for about 10 minutes. All of a sudden, someone (who happens to be the professor of a class Im in) walks by and asks Does it smell like burning plastic in here to anyone else?. I took a whiff, and lo and behold, there was a very strong odor. A repair man eventually determined the problem to be that the HVAC system was leaking fluids into the ventilation. I left the building soon after the professor made his remarks, but I did return briefly a couple times to see if it had gotten better and to retrieve the laptop I left there. Since then (this was about an hour ago), Ive kinda been feeling a weird sensation in my lungs or possibly my esophagus (not sure). How worried should I be about chemical inhalation, etc.?", "Health Anxiety Experience: HEALTH ANXIETY SYMPTOMS Hi guys, they said I have health anxiety, but I cant believe them because the symptoms are very real. Sometimes, I dont know if this is really anxiety. I went to hospital a lot of times and they said they dont find anything aside from my tubercolosis. But my doctor said that my TB is just mild and I dont have cough so its not a reason yet to give me shortness of breath. I also had three ECGs and it all came up normal. It is really possible that you wIll just experience anxiety symptoms without any reason? Like Im just playing computer and suddenly I cant breath. I worry most when I cant breath. YES! I cant breath. Its just suddenly. I;m not anxious about anything then suddenly I cant just breath.

Hi guys, Im 18 years old and I have been noticing irregular periods and weird bloody discharge. I have no pain whatsoever, not during sexual intercourse or while urinating.

The thing I struggle with the most is never being able to trust how Im feeling. Every single symptom I feel, I panic.. is this a real symptom? is this just my anxiety? do I have anxiety because of my symptom or do I have the symptom because of my anxiety I feel like Im going crazy, my family isnt supportive at all, a lot of the time I just need reassurence that Ill be okay, and yet all I get is sarcasm and jokes at my expense.

About a year ago I been to the doctors and asked about these lumps I had it turned out that the doctor said It was cause due to sickness and lymph nodes. I been feeling it through the year and havent disappeared yet.

Ive had so many tests, painful and otherwise, over the past several weeks. After finally getting a nearly clean bill of health, I brought up with my doctor the one thing I didnt think about until recently. I could feel a swollen lymph node just under my jaw over my carotid artery. what started to scare me, is that i realized I could feel that lymph node for something like 3 months. My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in that area. My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and theyre enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign. Ive been freaking out all day and Ive been trying to avoid the internet, but the soonest I can get in to see an ENT is next Tuesday, so I get to spend the next 4 days agonizing about this. Im 38 years old, and Ive been through so many health symptom scares over the past couple of months (mostly heart related) that the anxiety is just making me lose my mind...", "Health Anxiety Experience: Really scared of diabetes I am a major hypochondriac. This morning I woke up with terrible sharp pain in my left foot and odd bruising. My family doesnt seem to think its anything too strange but Im really worried that its diabetes.

I ask this because I have been going through something extremely odd in the last year. All my medical tests suggest I am perfectly healthy but the symptoms I have been facing with are unlike anything I have experienced before.

My symptoms are:  severe insomnia  Constant irritability  Confusion and brain fog (what I perceive as working memory issues)  muscle spasmsjerks  vision, hearing, and skin hypersensitivity I am not looking for a diagnosis just understanding the line between a medical condition and something that is just anxiety.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Was doing so well until right now I started a new medication a month or so ago, and it seems to have quashed the intensity of my health anxiety. I was overjoyed about this! Finally, I had hope of living a life that wasnt steered by hypochondria! But Im currently having a setback. Long story short, Ive been under a lot of stress lately. My girlfriend who I was really in love with broke up with me last week. That seems to be the major issue right now. But Im getting some troubling symptoms. All day, Ive had this weird pain in my chest. I attributed this to emotional pain and didnt think too much of it. Now, Im also feeling it in my back and the pain is more to the left side of my chest. I am having some left arm pain as well, and it almost feels like some weakness too, but I cant tell if this is my mind playing tricks on me. My heart is pounding, and Im feeling a little lightheaded. I just feel off. So, the 2 things Im worried about are a heart attack, or something called Broken Heart Syndrome, which is a very real condition and has been proven to exist. Im not asking for a diagnosis of course, but has anyone else experienced something like this?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Stress and Increased Health Concerns? Hey all. I have recently been experiencing a lot of stress with my job. I mean, a lot. I am trying my hardest to cool down, but I can definitely tell that my body is reacting to the stress. Stress hives, hyperventilating, and all the while an increased worry that these are symptoms of something like lyphoma. Just looking for some support.

Saturday my indoor cat scratched me pretty badly behind my ear (my fault, he hates being picked up). I made her mistake of reading online and found articles of people whose hearts have stopped and died from infected cat scratched. Its now Friday and I spent the week completely distracted from my life . Today I was supposed to work a double shift but I was so distracted and anxious at work I just left and am now at emergency. I have no idea how long Ill be here prob a long time. I feel like Ive created most of mhm symptoms (fatigue - anxiety is exhausting, sore throat, I smoked a lot on the weekend.

I got blood work done and it found my Ferritin to be high at 328 ugL and B12 high at 658 pmolL and high LDL cholesterol at 3.39 mmolL. My eGFR is 88 with Creatinine at 105 umolL and magnesium at 0.99 mmolL. My urine came back negative for protein, blood and nitrite. A week later I had Ferritin tested again and it was 427ugL. I also had an abdominal ultrasound which showed regular kidneys but a 3mm ployp was found on my gallbladder. It sound be noted that all the test Ive done thus far has not been for my kidneys but a pain in my abdomen which Im seeing a GI specialist for. Should I though look into my kidneys? As these findings from what Ive read may seem normal for an older person but not a 20 year old. Also would working out hard just over 24hr before the test affect the results? Or a meat heavy diet dispite a 12hr fast?

Just an average Saturday! I am so happy I found this sub, if for anything else to know that Im not the only one out here. I always do this...I work to ignore little things day after day that could be symptoms of something bigger, until suddenly I find that one thing that affirms that Ive been negligent and now Ill pay the price. Ive been in the obsession spiral since 11am today. I recently gave myself an undercut and I checked the back of my head in the mirror before leaving the house to get lunch and noticed a huge spot of hair missing at my neckline. By the time I got to the restaurant I was on a website confirming that I do in fact have lupus and sobbing while playing the conversation in my head of having to tell my mother. For a moment I break through the cloud and say look at yourself! You noticed what MIGHT be a bald spot and now you definitely have lupus?? Get out of the spiral. Youre fine. Then I fall right back in. How dare I enjoy this hot dog right now like nothing is wrong!? I have lupus for gods sake. Its so bewildering how it takes this hold. So now Ill work to distract myself until I can see a doctor, or the 800th time I check my hairline I can somehow convince myself that the spot has always been there and my hairline is just uneven.

Sometimes Ill just be talking with my bf and realize how illogical I sound, which is incredibly liberating to be wrong about my health concerns (since we all assume the worst). I will just cry a lot because its like the person I was before my health anxiety was able to break through for a second and hold a mirror to my thoughts. I try so hard to hold onto that feeling. But anxiety is too powerful sometimes and I cant help googling, asking my bf to look at something on my body, or simply thinking about death. Im so much better than last year and the year before but my anxiety is still there. I just want to be normal.

In the past year Ive lost 50ish pounds, and Im at a healthy weight for my height. I did restrictive diets to lose weight, but at this point Im working out so if I gain weight I dont really care because I know I wont gain weight in my stomach. Theres just one problem. In September, I had my gallbladder removed. Im not supposed to be eating oily food, but Im a teen so of course Im going to. The first month after my surgery, I ate like a pig and I didnt exercise. I lost 10 pounds. I have bulimia, but Im in recovery and I dont purge often at all (like only 1-2 times a month when I relapse). At this point, I literally cant stop eating. Ill be full as hell but I still cant stop. Ive recorded it, and Ive been eating about 3500-4000 calories a day for the past few weeks (according to my Fitbit, I only burn about 2200). I havent gained a pound. All Ive done is lost (1-2 pounds a week). I should also mention that I have super low blood pressure (the doctors dont know why; I eat salty stuff all the time). Every time I stand up, I get lightheaded and spotty vision and I have to lean against something. I dont know what to do. Any medical professional that I talk to about this says that Im just a teen with a high metabolism.

My therapist says that exposure therapy is one of the best ways to treat health anxiety disorder, which were starting on Thursday. Just wondered how many of you are currently receiving treatment of any kind, and how many have tried this particular modality.

Dont have any pain, no tingling or weakness or anything, skin hasnt changed color, theyre certainly not misshapen like varicose veins...

It was removed and biopsy confirmed as benign. HPV, specifically HPV-16 found to be a major risk factor for oralthroat cancers possibly contracted by kissing, oral sex, towels and other methods. It triggered major health anxiety within me and my life practically ended. I quit my job, I stopped any type of intimate relationships and basically waiting for life to have a miserable cancer ending. I did about 10 times oral sex in my life in total (about 5 different women) and now Im certain I contracted HPV in my throat according to the statistics that everyone got that virus. I dont even know if I should vaccinate (Im 36) because the manufacturer itself says it could increase the risk of cancer if you already got infected with HPV-16HPV-18. Yes I know in 90 the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead. There is no cure, there is no test and Im positive Im headed for cancer. I tried doctors, GPs, ENTs, CBT therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me. My life is practically over.

About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbors cat that had jumped over the fence. I didnt want them to get in a fight so I shood the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 12 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that Im being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesnt help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesnt help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that Ive been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive.

I hear its dangerous to consume a pill that is crushed or broken down because it gives you large dosage at once. The good part is that I didnt swallow even half of what was inside the flomax pill.

Ive called to try and get my results from the mammogramultra sound but they wont give them to me over the phone (which I understand). I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday. Im wondering if this was the process those of you with breast cancer (or any cancer really) went through test wise or do I have nothing to worry about?", "Health Anxiety Experience: emetophobia Im so tired of thinking about the stomach bug constantly. I cant even have a normal life. Im so worried about every meal becoming the one I have to throw up later. I worry my kids are gonna wake up and be sick with the stomach bug.

Just recently, Ive been experiencing a lot of dizziness, slight heartburn  stomach aches, and heat flashes. Heat flashes arent exceptionally uncommon for me. I also get a lot of stomachaches. Im not too worried about those. I have bad anxiety in general to begin with, so when I started noticing (around Tuesday or so) I was getting this dizzying brain fog sort of thing I really began to freak out. Ive never experienced it before and Im worried its something serious. Im chalking it up to stress right now (just had a family death, general school stress, being broke, lack of sleep, etc) but Im really worried. It hasnt stopped. I feel like Im about to faint frequently. Its weird to describe, but its almost like my brain is going a few steps too far ahead of my body. Sometimes vice verse. I stumble a lot when it happens and often need to hang on to something to steady myself. Ive noticed this is mostly happening when I stand. Its not as frequent or severe as when Im laying down, which makes it really hard to get stuff done. I dont think its dehydration or a lack of sleep, either. Ive been getting 10 hours of sleep in since it began and Ive been drinking as much water and Gatorade as possible. Has anyone else experienced this? Should I be calling a doctor?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Has anyone else have had this type of anxiety attack? I have generalized anxiety but for the past couple of months, due to the death of a loved one, my health anxiety, which was already present, has skyrocketed. Anyway, yesterday I started feeling anxious about something else than my health and then I had some coffee and started to feel sick, like I was dizzy, confused and nauseous. Health anxiety showed up again. While I was walking home I was constantly thinking I was going to die right there in the street and I started crying. I kept thinking I dont want to die in the street like this. At least let me get home before I die.. I got home and my relatives tried to comfort me, but I couldnt calm down. I kept crying and feeling ill. I even vomited a little. Anyway, they helped me test my temperature and blood pressure and blood sugar and they all looked fine, but I was not feeling fine at all. Eventually I did calm down, but it felt like forever. And I still feel physically bad, so to say. I have aches and pains all over all the time. I feel like Im 80 and Im only 25.

So on Wednesday I made a steak at home and got a string of fat stuck in between my back right two teeth. After eating when to floss and pick it out, and digged around for a while. I think I got the piece out but my gums were bleeding a good amount. Note I do have healthy teeth and go to the dentist every year. On Saturday afternoon that tooth and jaw area had a dull pain, made me stay in the night as it was just annoying. Today woke up and for the first hour seemed alright but that dull pain is now back. The thing is I am in the army and we are going to the field (woods for training) these next two weeks. So I wont be able to go see a dentist. Today is my last free day.

I had a friend who passed away a few years ago while running due to an undiagnosed heart defect that he was born with.

Health anxiety fucks me up like daily, but this week its been super bad. So my fiance and I found a mouse in our room and kept it in a box for a bit because we had just had a bad snowstorm and dont want to put it out there and have it freeze. Weve been packing because were about to move and so weve been kicking stuff up, but havent found any droppings. Of course after we caught the mouse there were droppings in the box. Anyway, now about a week and a half later, I have heavy chest pressure, a dry cough, and back pain in the area of pleurisy. I went to medemerge last night and my blood pressure was 9865, pretty low, but the doctor kept saying how great it was.

Im so tired of it. Ive wasted so much money going to the ER because the triage nurse suggested it based on my symptoms or because I was hunched over in pain for hours. I dont know if Im a hypochondriac or what but Im always at the doctors office and my job is very much at risk. At this point Im saying fuck it, if my appendix bursts then let it. If my iud punctures my uterus or becomes embedded in the uterine lining and causes digestive infection then let it. It would be better than living in pain just to be told nothing is wrong with me. Better than to be known as the unreliable employee.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Today I declined doctors appointment. I had a dizziness episode and went to an ER. They did ECG, brain scan, blood-work and did not find anything. My doctors office called after couple of days (I guess ER sends them medical records) and asked if I wanted to schedule a followup.

Ive also been experiencing rapid heart rates from little physical activity and high blood pressure. I do have pretty severe health anxiety and also suffer from digestive problems as well so I can be sure if it is just my anxiety manifesting physical symptoms. I went to the ER last week and they said the blood tests showed no signs of it being heart related but my PCP decided to have me wear a heart monitor patch for a week and that made me more conscious of my palpitations and pains. Today is first day since Ive taken it off and sent it in.

This last year, Ive graduated university and started a new career. Everythings been very stressful, and somehow its impacted my HA too. The thing I noticed is that it always gets worse and more intense during the winter months and beginning of spring. I get back pains, my joints start to ache, I feel tired,... which triggers unhealthy and irrational thoughts and anxiety about my health (for the last month I was absolutely sure I had heart problems, lung cancer, an aneurysm, and some other illnesses). Its absolutely crazy. I dont know, but its often this way. It always gets worse during the period of january - april.

I dont know how to explain it, really, but the only health anxiety I have is usually kind of sudden things that could kill me, like aneurysms, embolisms, all that. Ive never worried about cancers, really, or long-term sort of degenerative things. I almost think its because its the fear of not knowing something is coming. Im afraid the X-Ray missed something and that my aorta is going burst or something. Like, if I knew something was coming, I would be able to tie up loose ends, spend time with friends and family, take a vacation, and live until I die. I wouldnt be happy about it, obviously, but I never get very anxious about things like that. The things that scare me are things that could just randomly kill me while Im studying or playing video games or something.

Ive been on Reddit for a while, but havent posted here. Basic backstory... Im 34 female, son died in 2009, was diagnosed with PTSD and general anxiety. Health (in real life) began to fail after his death. I have since been diagnosed with POTS, fibromyalgia, PACs, diabetes, had two colonoscopies with polyp removal, gall bladder removed, three ruptured discs in my neck and recently had pneumonia at the beginning of February. The pneumonia brought back severe symptoms of HA. They hadnt gone away completely, but I had made real progress. Yesterday I finally went to the doctor after three days of chest pain thinking maybe the pneumonia was recurring. After the x-ray, I was told I was negative for pneumonia but I have a 1cm nodule in my right lung. She said they are usually benign, but of course, Im flipping my shit. I have smoked for 22 of my 34 years on this planet, so lung cancer is a real, legitimate fear. I have to wait for two months for reexamination to check for growth.

Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as Ive realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasnt properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, Ive gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, Ive had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. Allow me to think out loud: - can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose? - is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution? - would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constantprogressively worse? I know a much more effecting outlet would have been distracting myself or using other anxiety relieving techniques.. but I couldnt resist venting on here. Im struggling! I know the questions I posed are mostly unanswerable.

It seemed like my left leg or knee had just given out, but I was still able to stand. After a couple minutes it went away and I was walking normally. I ended up going to the ER after speaking with a nurse. All blood tests came back normal and so did the physical tests. The doctor checked my eyes, walking, reflexes, etc. Its the next day and I cant help but feel like they missed something and that I could have possibly had a TIA (ministroke), which can be a warning sign for a stroke. I even told them I was feeling lightheaded the day before but I dont know what is just anxiety now. Still feeling out of it and being hyperaware of my body right now.

My boyfriend and I have been dating for over two years now and I always sorta joked about how he was a hypochondriac, but hes shared some recent concerns with me and Ive realized how severe his anxiety is behind it. A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that hes terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because its not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesnt want it to be confirmed true. He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasnt talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy.

So, last August I found a lump, I had a CT, an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then Ive had Chemo, Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first Scans are normal meeting with the Onco. Hooray! That said, the health anxiety Im experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache, twitch, twinge, anything makes me worry unnecessarily. As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since, but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen, which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. Its internal and normally I cant feel it unless Ive sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally theres a spot or two of blood on my crap, and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright, bright red, but otherwise my bms are consistent size, shape, colour and bloodless - they just scratch a little as they pass.

I had a big episode where I thought I was dying of an aneurysm, and went to the doctor and all that and figured out that it was not the case, so Ive been through all that, but I still cant help this nagging feeling of WTF IS IT THEN?? Initially I theorized that it must be my headphones causing it (headband is too tight), because the pain seems to be coming from muscles on the outside of skull, as shown by how when I massage it the pain temporarily suppresses.

However this morning I woke up and it seemed to have moved mostly out of my head and into my chest. I just have a pretty minor cough going on. However Ive also been experiencing some mild chest pains and also this feeling of an obstruction when I breath in, but I can still get a deep breath. Occasionally it might feel like I cant. Also it feels like there might be some chest tightness or pressure. Throughout the course of this cold Ive been afraid of it turning into pneumonia, so obviously this is making me pretty anxious.

Like, Im clumsy overall and I sometimes trip or bump onto things, but never so often. Also, when handing the change to the customer (Im a student but I work part time as a cashier) I dropped a coin twice. Or when he asked me for certain cigarretes, I grabbed the blue instead of red ones etc. After the day of overall lack of concentration I started googling and I found that brain tumor may cause clumsiness, loss of concentration, balance etc. I had a CT scan done 4 years ago due to head trauma but it was clear.

The health anxiety dissipated and I was able to function. But, after a dizzy spell over easter and a whole bunch of stomach problems from eating too many things Im intolerant to, Ive had a major relapse. Im back to not sleeping, I can feel my heartbeat constantly, Im Googling non-existent symptoms and struggling to function again. Im hoping this is just a temporary relapse, a speed hump in what has otherwise been a pretty linear recovery. What do you do in periods of anxiety to make yourself well again? What has helped you in the past? What should I do to help me get out of bed in the morning and function through a full day?

I have had health anxiety most of my adult life, it comes and goes, changes depending on my life stresses and what is happening.

Apparently the doctor the year before told me to get it biopsied, but I didnt book a follow up appointment. (I call BS, if the previous doctor had told me I needed it checked, I would have been pushing for the next available appointment). So I had it biopsied yesterday, and the Dr wrote path report BCC? (Basel cell carsinoma). So I have now googled the life out if it and convinced myself it is the worst possible outcome, overanalysed every comment the Drs said during the procedure (its not coming out easily!

I left it too long!?? ) My skin and moles have never been a trigger for me in the past despite it being a likely genuine health problem for me (fair skin, family history etc).

A year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. It was only 3mm, but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case, which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. During my second ultrasound, the polyp was a little bigger -- this time, 4mm -- and my doctor seemed worried. But he seems like he gets worried easily, so I dont really know how I should feel... My moms gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45, and it turned out hers had precancerous cells (cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer).

I went to the dermatologist, he gave me anti biotics. Its been 2 days with the anti biotics (ciprofloxacin) and its still inflamed, arguably worse than ever. Ibuprofen helps but not enough. Sleeping is so god damn difficult. The dermatologist said that these things can go deep which scared the shit out of me. Ive let this thing just sort of stay there for years now and I am terrified that a surgery would basically take a huge chunk of the entire area out just to get rid of this thing. I actually had a surgery for it years ago but that was when it FIRST appeared, and that was bad enough. I hate this so fucking much.

Day for about 3 months I fears ALS, Brain Tumors, Stomach Cancer and Esophageal Cancer. It was awful. Well I managed to get past that and I joined the army, finished my basic and job training schools and went home for the holidays. Well, the past few days Ive been having some stomach discomfort and I was even in the hospital a week ago because of the pain (they told me it was just acid and the antacid they gave me seemed to fix the problem.) Now Im extremely nervous, Im so close to googling stomach cancer symptoms and I havent yet. I know if I do everything will come unraveled but Im having trouble fighting this. What do I do?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Should I be concerned about stomach cancer? Im a 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having symptoms described below and it would come and go every couple months. So about 2 months ago I started having stomach issues with gas, being constantly full, zero appetite and little pains in my stomach. The pains faded after 2 weeks and the last 2 months it feels as if my stomach isnt producing enough acid. I dont know what is going on. I have zero pain during or after eating. The only symptom I have is the feeling of my food not being digested after eating and being full for hours and hours after eating. I have ZERO appetite. And also after eating my gut gets very gurgle and makes lots of noises. Ill even workout twice a day and fast till dinner and still have zero appetite. I usually consume 400-600 mg of caffeine wether its multiple cups of coffee, tea or pre workout so I dont know if that is bad. My anxiety has been very high worrying about stomach cancer. Anyone have any idea what this could be? Is it the caffeine? Does caffeine ruin your stomach? Is this cancer or chronic gastritis?

Does anyone else get an attack of acid reflux when they are in a panic? My wife tends to get a lot of foamy sputum coming up when shes getting a full bore attack which appears to be due to saliva mixed with stomach acid. This, she feels, hinders her breathing and its only once shes cleared it does things start to settle but as with all health anxiety shes still concerned this is due to something else.

She wants me to log my blood pressure and return it to her after about two weeks. What Im curious about is, to be diagnosed with high blood pressure, does it have to stay elevated above 12080 all the time or if it gets up to higher than 12080 often its considered high blood pressure? How exactly is high bp diagnosed? Is this something can kill me soon or is it a risk for the future?

Lately I masturbated two times in a short period of time (within about 1 hour I guess) after the first ejaculation I had no pain in my lower area.

So for the past year Ive been having this weird symptom on and off, and it freaks me out every time. It only happens when I get out of the shower.

Theres no pain, numbness or tingling, Just extremely red. Normally it only happens when I get out of the shower, but I got off the couch tonight and it happened.

I got a new cat about 3 months ago, and shes a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. Shes about 9 months old now and very rambunctious, and quite a cutie. However, as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy, rolls around a lot, and loves biting me. Like, LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times, no infections due to careful cleaning after. I read that rabies usually shows 2-3 months after infection, and upwards of a year, so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her (shes 100 an indoor cat now) she could start showing symptoms. Is it at all possible, or am I being a doof? Also, should mention, got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.

Then a couple days ago I got hit like a ton of bricks. I havent been able to focus on or accomplish anything for days now and could really use some perspective. About three months ago I was bitten on the leg by a small dog while out on a run. It was a small bite, barely broke the skin, and it turned out to be my neighbors dog.

Ive been drugged up most of the weekend, and for the most part the intense pain is gone but whats left is a weak arm and numbness in my elbow and most of the fingers on my left hand. I see my doc tomorrow. Its likely a pinched nerve or tendinitis. The ER doc said my muscles were tight and the pain was intense spasms (Im talking worse than childbirth-Ive had two kids). Of course MY brain goes to worst case scenario like cancer and my body is riddled with tumours.

I did, and hit it a few more times through out the night. Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didnt eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!

I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22, which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed (which I am now). I will post the full story in the comments. It seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, Im here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact, I was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months. The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea, AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on.

They did a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work. In the end, I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24-hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung (probably from a childhood of asthma, bronchitis, and pleurisy). No big deal. However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldnt sleep on Thursday (theyre at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, Ive now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and, just an hour after, the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am.

Over the last year I decided to improve my anxiety problems. I had an experience recently that kind of personified how I went about learning to cope better. Basically, when I was in high school, smoking weed usually gave me panic attacks until after it actually set in. After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug.

One day I had chest pain, and then every day for months after that I dug myself deep into this dark chasm that is health anxiety. At my lowest, I was up till 4 am on WedMD every night, almost got fired from my job, and most importantly - living in chronic PHYSICAL pain. The TLDR of my story is that rather than seeking comfort (hot baths, heating pads, painkillers), I began to seek discomfort and that led me to what I now understand as rewilding. Basically, you are reaffirming your body how strong and capable you really are, by exposing yourself to elements that we humans previously had to deal with constantly....long before the days of anxiety lol. Take some cold showers. Go out into the elements for at least 20 minutes a day. Develop a deeper relationship with your breath.

The man responsible for the term is [Daniel Vitalis](http:www.danielvitalis.comrewild-yourself-podcast). But there are others doing similar stuff, such as Wim Hof.

I was on Zoloft at the time for my anxiety and depression due to a crappy upbringing and social anxiety. Flash forward to now.

Since getting healthier and stopping substances, my body has freaked out and feels like complete garbage every day. I have constant heart palpitations, tingling and headaches.

When I scheduled the appointment, I listed the three most worrisome or annoying symptoms as the reason for going in.

What do you do when you have many different symptoms? I know that people can have multiple illnesses at once, but the fact that my symptoms are in a few different, probably unrelated areas makes me worry that my dr will just assume that everything is in my head (and yes, Im aware that much of it could be all in my head). Im also worried that if I mention that all this feeling ill exacerbates my anxiety and that my anxiety exacerbates my feeling ill that shell write me off as a nut case.

Im 36 years, old, I have two kids, currently nursing a 1 year old. About 4-6 months ago, I started losing weight. Initially I thought nothing of it, I figured it was just being a busy mom! But fast forward and within that time, I caught just the most random viruses, and badly. I caught a flu that immediately turned to pneumonia. I caught a viral rash from my 4 year old niece. My weight kept dropping. At this point, I started to become understandably anxious and curious as to what was happening. I had bloodwork during my pneumonia that came back normal in her eyes. But I noticed today there was elevated platelet count and low lymphocytes. Which are commonly linked to cancer of some sort. Why did I google it? Im just spinning out, because I lost my dad recently to a very rare aggressive cancer. Something just doesnt add up. Im just scared that it is something seriously wrong. Im getting more bloodwork done to hopefully alleviate my worries now that I am healthy... it could just have been related to the pneumonia, and the weight loss to nursing, anxiety and being a busy mom.

Long story short is that i went to the DRs to get routine bloodwork done after stressing for a month, i also had her check my thyroid and hormones because after having irregular periods and feeling anxious i figured that hormones had to be it. My blood work came back fine except my testosterone was high. I started having a work up done on my ovaries and kidneys to check for tumors. My friend is a nurse at the office i was at and had the ultrasound tech check my kidneys extra well even tho it wasnt a dedicated test for them because she knew i was afraid of a adrenal tumor. The tech couldnt find anything and said if there was something there she would of seen it...but that wasnt good enough of a answer for me.

Since then shes been on medicines and her condition has improved significantly in last 12 years. A few years ago I started having heart palpitations which were more noticeable after I did some exercise. I was af and my parents took me to the ER but they said its just anxiety, but as my mom has this condition, I should get it checked out. We went to the cardiologist the next day who ran some tests like ECG, Echo and bloodwork and everything came out normal. After a few months I stopped noticing the symptoms, even while exercising. I still get palpitations when Im going through a phase of anxiety but rarely otherwise. Out of curiosity, I surfed the internet about cardiomyopathy and came to know that a person has 50 chance of inheriting the faulty gene from their affected parent and Im really scared now. The articles even mentioned that in some cases the first diagnosis comes to light when a family member dies suddenly, due to cardiac arrest. Im really scared now, of developing this disease now or in the near future and I dont really know what I can do about it. I want to mention one more thing that my moms heart pumping has come back to normal but she still takes the medicine because a condition is a condition, so the prognosis is good in her case.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Hearing loss At what point do I talk to my doctor about not being able to hear well. Ive noticed more and more struggling to hear. Last time I asked she said I just had fluid in my ear and said it would be fine.

And after the flu it seems like it had gotten a lot worse. And being in public with hearing issues is making my anxiety skyrocket. What really scares me even more is my mom had a tumor removed from her ear area that was causing hearing loss. What do I do? Can anyone comfort me? Is this a reason to go to the walk in or do i need to make a regular appointment?

I can never tell if my high blood pressure causes my anxiety attacks or the other way around. I guess its not possible to know. I just ate fast food for the first time in a while, which seemingly cause my blood pressure to spike. My heart rate was up as if I was on a brisk walk for an hour, despite just sitting and doing deep breathing exercises. It was probably just all of the excess sodium but I just couldnt calm myself back down for anything. I know that digestion in general will cause a higher heart rate but when my head starts to feel hot and tight like a balloon I just have a hard time shaking the idea that something bad is about to happen.

Ive had this problem on and off for a while where itll flare up for a few days and then go away for a while. I have no idea what triggers it. Its always the left side of my neck under my jaw. Im assuming its a lymph node, but I cant feel anything when I feel around in that area. But the pain is very localized to that one spot, when I press on it or turn my head itll hurt right there. It also hurts when I swallow but not in a sore throat way, more like something is bumping against that inflammation and irritates it. I might go to the walk-in clinic today because Im sick of worrying about it. I have no other symptoms besides a small headache between my eyebrows which started up about two days ago and has stayed pretty constant. It feels like a sinus headache but I dont have the other symptoms besides my typically slightly stuffy nose.

I used to work at a cancer hospital and had severe health anxiety about brain tumors. I went to several doctors, all of which said I was healthy. I finally worked up the courage to go to a neurologist and upon seeing how anxious I was, she gave me a brain MRI. It turns out that I had an incidental finding which was benign brain calcification. She said it is unremarkable and the rest was deemed normal. I had another CT a year later, and the size was unchanged. So that could indicate Ive just had it my whole life and means nothing, and they pushed the next CT to 5 years away (which would be next year or the year after). They did say that if Im having symptoms such as a headache (they gave no other symptoms), that we can schedule it sooner. Im just terrified that its multiplying in my brain right now or something. I have terrible health anxiety and get horrible symptoms, especially with vision. Im just nervous that its the calcification causing this and not my anxiety. Has anyone else had experience with this?

As stupid as this sounds, my anxiety is telling me that since I was eating a grape and laughed and coughed a bit, I inhaled the juice and my lungs are going to react. Should I worry? The long version is: I laughed while eating a grape and it caused me to cough, it was more coughing than Im used to and it burned a bit, so I was worried that I didnt cough it out well enough. Im feeling a little tired now (6hrs later) and short of breath and my mucus is that sickly yellow. I felt immediate pain an hour after it happened but I dont feel it anymore, but most of these might be health anxiety.

They pretty much went away from like Monday to Thursday, except for a dull feeling, but now that is gone as well. So should I be worried of something such as a brain tumor? I was diagnosed with an ear infection but I am taking antibiotics. I havent really had any other issues. I have been stressed about my short term memory, but I am able to recall stuff well but I sometimes forgot about tasks I need to do. I do have ADHD so I believe this is the cause, but I tend to remember the tasks. I also have some moments where I am zoning out because I am thinking so much, but this only happens when I am in front of a computer and I am usually able to recognize that I am not paying attention and snap out of it, so I dont believe I am having seizures.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Is it normal to have heart palpatations whe lying down?

So I honestly do believe we should move more away from I have x,y,z symptoms am I going to die? to How can I find peace of mind and stop googling One thing I do to get peace of mind is watch this episode of [Hey Arnold](https:www.wco.tvhey-arnold-season-2-episode-5-monkey-business-2) which is my all time favourite show (its only the first episode in the video provided called monkey business btw), I wont ruin it for you all, but its really funny and will hit home for all of us, it highlights how silly we can be sometimes when we think we have a really bad illness and start obsessing over symptoms.

However, on none of these occasions have any follow-up appointments been scheduled, each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension.

Ugh. Hi, So Ive been away for a while from this sub trying to sort myself out. I had a massive colon cancer scare end of 2017 beginning of 2018 which subsided after numerous tests at doctors.

During the course of the sickness, I experienced sweating at night and joint pains. Fast forward to today, I no longer have the 3 symptoms, I might even add that I feel recovered! However, the oddity is that the body aches and joint pains still lingers as if I was sick and it has been affecting my sleep. If I were to describe the pain, it feels like its my entire body with the most painful part being my ribtorso area. I was wondering if this is normal? Any thoughts?

I now spend hours reading the criteria for BPD, taking BPD symptom tests over and over again, reading accounts of BPD on medicalmental health subreddits, to see if my experiences fit. Its even more hellish than health anxiety Ive had about physical health problems because there is no definitive test, one professional could say I have it and the other could disagree for example, there is no objective qualification for whether I have it and Im scared to even bring it up to a professional because I dont want to plant the seed in their mind and be treated worse because its so highly stigmatized.

I decided to take a break from scaring myself to death with medical craziness online and (for once) actually wanted to learn about Hypochondria (I guess you could say it was an eye opening moment where I, myself, saw myself from a logical standpoint). As I sifted through the Google pages, I ended up coming across a slew of articles relating to Hypochondria being one of the earliest signs of Frontotemporal Lobe Dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. My first initial reaction was complete anger. I had abused my Google privileges for so long, looking at the scariest possible diseases. The one time I do exactly what people have been telling me to do (dude, look up what ANXIETY does to your body and mind, not this) I get forced back into hell. As you can imagine, I checked it out. There were actually many articles and case reports regarding it that it kinda scared me.

Apparently it wont effect him till his old but what the hell ! Straight down the rabbit hole, googling away... heart pumping, i bet i have leukemia, im certain, i dont know what else it could be...

Of course, having gone through this countless times, I began to do what Ive been working on with my counselor, which is essentially using mindfulness to talk myself off the ledge of thinking I was dying.

If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because Ive died young. To reassure myself, I tell myself that Im making it up it my head, I dont have cancer, its so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another symptom and the cycle continues. But lately Ive been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from I dont have x disease, Im OK to I probably dont have x disease, but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok, I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to.", "Health Anxiety Experience: CWD is freaking me out My uncle likes to hunt deer here in Texas, and he sends us venison sausage from time to time after an especially successful hunting trip.

I mentioned it at my appointment, got my right eye dilated, and boom... white spot in my nerve layer. Didnt have it on my checkup 12 days prior.

Started diagnosing myself foolishly with all kinds of different things from heart problems, a ministroke, MS, brain tumor, the works. Went from 0 to hypochondriac in weeks. Went to my doctor and got some tests for thyroid and such, all fine. My BP is slightly high at 13582 as well. Most of the symptoms of everything has gone away, except my vision. I woke up one morning about 6-7 days ago with.. not what I would call blurry vision, but almost an otherworldly filter applied to it. Nothing is any more difficult to read, no flashing, no pain, no color changes, but things are just hard to look at and Ive got a bit of tunnel vision going on. Ive always had floaters in my vision and there arent any new ones, but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.

Im not sure if this is what is causing my shortness of breath, as the shortness of breath never goes away, its there 247. Yesterday I went to a walk in clinic to get examined for my shortness of breath and the doctor noticed a slight wheeze which sent me into a spiral of health anxiety as, me thinking I have sarcoma, I thought it mightve spread to the lungs or something. Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale (dont remember what its called) and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results, but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So, in short, is this shortness of breath from anxiety, or could it be a very minor case of asthma?

I can move it, but I heard that numb fingers or tingling in your left hand can be a sign of a heart attack. The thing is, I went to ER twice and my ECG was good. I have slight tachycardia and Im not convinced that Im healthy, despite the doctors telling me everythings fine.

This is mostly fueled by any story of new chemical used in products and only 51020 years later people confirm its a carcinogen  otherwise dangerous. Because of this I get stressed out with chemical things like cleaning products, detergents, anything scented, general air pollutants, clothing dye, any drinking water, plastics touching food, heavily processed foods, and so much more. Im struggling to get over it because these cases do happen, and I wouldnt know there was a problem until it was too late; I cant shake the feeling it is rational to at least have some skepticism... but I know its impossible to know about everything and I want to stop stressing out so much. any coping tips or advice would be great, thank you.", "Health Anxiety Experience: TFW i convince myself im going into hypothermia by using a thermometer i know is broken Seriously fml", "Health Anxiety Experience: Pro tip: dont Google symptoms if youre logged into Facebook. They will use the data from your searches to give you relevant ads and articles and it will exacerbate your HA. There have been times where Ive frantically googled the symptoms for everything from MS to brain tumors to ruptured ovarian cysts and shortly afterwards I would see an ad or an article about something related to it-- nearby gynecologists, cancer centers, etc. But since Ive stopped doing that, I dont see them as much anymore.

Hi guys, this is the first time I post in this subreddit, so, lets get started! For about two weeks I have been feeling very frightened about the idea of being depressed, also because this anxiety is accompanied by a kind of weight that I feel inside my chest and that accompanies me all the days. I havent lost interest in activities or in socializing, but when I am at home alone I start to think and look on the internet for symptoms and feelings about depression, and end up feeling scared, anguished and sad with this feeling of heavy head and the impossibility of thinking positive.

First I want to say thank you to everyone in this sub. Ive been quietly reading your posts for months now and it is truly the reason I dont feel so alone anymore. Ive been dealing with health anxiety since I was 12. I saw a poster in the nurses office at school which explained the symptoms of menengitis and spent almost a year touching my chin to my neck to make sure I was okay. Then, it turned into having anxiety about HIVAIDS and lymphoma. My anxiety was so bad I had to drop out of my dream college because I couldnt handle it. I felt happy for years after that. I focused on other things. But this January something changed. I suddenly began feeling everything I used to before. Constantly worried about various diseases even after being reassured that I was okay. Its straining my relationships with my family, my boyfriend, and my friends.

Ive read some books and other sufferers on forums told me some techniques. What Ive been using is more ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy) than CBT. And it was quite helpful for me. I have always had problems challenging the thought, its much easier to accept it and let it float past me as clouds as just anxiety. Lately Ive read on Wikipedia that CBT is a gold-standard approach.

I was told a while back I had a lesion in my leg that was most likely benign and then that was it. I didnt hear anything back from any doctor about it and I didnt know where to go or what to do about it and my HA went through the roof because of it. I recently went to my main doctor and asked him about it. He told me they cant legally say 100 something is benign because they can be sued over it, but reallistically it most likely was benign. He said that I could always get an x-ray if I needed reassurance to make sure it hasnt changed ar all. My question is this, what do you guys think you would do in my position? I have had enough radiation in my body already and I want to avoid it as much as possible. And I feel like maybe not going and getting the x-ray can teach me more skills that I need to cope.

(Gross?) Ive been struggling with this particular health anxiety for some months now. Ive been suffering heavily from health anxiety for 9 months now. But this isnt some muscle ache or dizziness I can just ignore. The stool keeps going from having weeks where its too soft, to weeks where its semi back to normal. Sometimes I see small red...bits? in it. When I went to my doctor about it the first time, I performed a couple of feces tests. I got a slightly elevated white blood cell count on one of them. Then like 2 months ago I cried hysterically because I started dripping fresh red blood after a visit. Doctor discovered that there was a small hemorroid near the opening. Ive done more tests much later on, so far theyve come out negative, I have one more test I need to do that is quite time consuming. He assured me that its way too rare that it can be colon cancer (Im 20 and have no history) and that he sees no real reason to worry. But Im relapsing again two weeks after feeling fine about it. I got a very small amount of blood. I know its much more likely that it was a tear cause it hurt quite a bit coming out. But it awakened the beast from its slumber...

Im an introvert and spend a lot of time indoors, horribly afraid of cancer and now Im convinced Im going to develop lung cancer.

It all started with me having a tight throat feeling which I have because of GERD (I didnt know at that time), and I searched it up on google and all my symptoms matched thyroid cancer, etc. I got panic attacks, laying in bed for hours searching on google at age 13. It became so bad that I never went outside. I used to either tell my friends Im sick, or just talk to them over the phone to something. 2014 is when I developed my first real disease, called Visual Snow, symptoms are where you are tiny dots over your vision, like pixels. Luckily Ive managed to ignore that and accepted it as a part of me. At age 16 I dropped out of high school because I was unable to wake up in the morning and get ready. Since I dropped out of high school I developed BDD (Body Dysmorphia). It became so bad that I never went out in daylight. I checked the mirrors every 30 minutes, hated my face, etc. Now Im 18 and have noticed 4 months ago that my tongue twitches in the mirror (fasciculations).

Im worried I still might have it :(", "Health Anxiety Experience: Anxiety at it again over mice this time. What do you do to ease your mind? Ive had health anxiety in the past about rabies and amoeba. Each episode is weeks apart sometime a good couple months. Since Monday its been about hantavirus. Which I might add being in Australia, there hasnt been any cases as of yet and to my knowledge dont have deer mice which are apparently a more common mouse to carry the virus. Nonetheless, on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo, then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didnt touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands, I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I cant be sure. Anywho, ever since then when I googled mouse poo originally just to see what it looked like and it lead me down a health anxiety hole so to say. There is some mouse poo around my area as I work near the kitchen, however I didnt notice until I accidently picked a bit up off my desk with my bare hand. I know its unlikely to get Hanta, I have posted in other threads however it doesnt ease my mind. How do you ease your mind when having anxiety over some disease?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Nausea So recently my fear of throwing up has come back, im pretty sure it happened after a night of heavy drinking and that lead to me getting sick. So ever since that night ive basically been in fear of it happening again, so for about id say 3 weeks now im basically just always nauseous, i feel horrible but eventually forced myself too eat. In a huge twist that no one saw coming after eating I actually felt better, so my brain was like a-ha! I did it! I know its just anxiety!

Im actually up right now writing this feeling nauseous yet strangely hungry, and yes i know if youre really hungry sometimes you feel nauseous, but the nauseous i have most nights im fairly sure isnt that. I know this is probably written horribly but i havent been sleeping well as im sure you can imagine, but basically what im looking for, is has anyone else had anything like this, and what did you do to help yourself?

Today is my 25th birthday and I am overwhelmed with stress about these palpitations. Im 510 and 210lbs, so a tad overweight. I have been to several doctors and a cardiologist over the last 4 years (the cardiologist visit was just about 6 months ago) and no one can seem to find anything wrong with my heart. My blood tests come back great, my echocardiogram results were immaculate. I even wore an event monitor for a few days and it recorded a few episodes that my cardiologist told me were no cause for concern. But I just cant shake the feeling that there is something seriously wrong with me. I can go weeks or months without noticing a single skipped beat or flutter, and other times (like today) where I have 10 or more in a day! They scare me. Some are very light and feel like a small jolt. Others feel like a big flutter or thud and usually make me jerk or gasp. Sometimes I feel out of breath from them. I do go the gym every day and never get them while exercising, which is a good thing. I have never fainted or passed out or anything either. They dont hurt.

This is pretty superstitious, but basically its the fear of the fact that often things happen when you least expect them, so Im afraid to stop expecting them to happen in order to control them into not happening. The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, its going to be more of a letdown. This already happened this year. I got a very small Pilonidal Cyst (now on track to get a minor procedure to remove it), and at first I was devastated - mostly because for a while I had forgotten about the possibility of these things happening, so there was more of a shock value.

Im and 18F student and ever since coming to college Ive had very bad health anxiety, where as soon as any small thing is wrong Im online 8-10 hours a day trying to diagnose.

Its very itchy, mostly at night, and when I scratch I get hive-like spots that sometimes stay, and sometimes go away. I also have little white bumps that are very tiny and dont show up well in pictures. Ive been applying hydrocortisone 1 since Saturday night and its still happening so today I bought Benadryl cream and made an appt at my universities health services for tomorrow morning. After looking online Ive narrowed it down to hives, eczema, scabies, or maybe ringworm. I think scabies scares me the most. I woke up this morning to myself scratching my wrists like crazy after doing so good not scratching, and then I started hyperventilating because I was so scared because I have read scabies is worst at night. Also, Ive been feeling itchy around my ears, scalp, and legs but nothing is as itchy or hive like as my wrists. Overall I dont really know what else to do as everytime I look at it I freak out and I cant talk to anyone about it because they laugh when I say it might be scabies or something serious.

When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment (a lordotic curve), whether from past trauma (e.g. whiplash, repetitive micro trauma), or poor posture, it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors (headaches, dizziness, vision issues, brain fog, fatigue etc.). A formal x-rayCTMRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong (bone spurs, herniations etc.) with the vertebrae or disc space, but a non-lordotic curve does cause real symptoms. I came across this information through physiochiro, so if youre someone that slouches and has migraines and headaches, try keeping your chin tucked in, dont stay in awkward positions, take breaks from computer work, drink water, get a comfortable pillow, and keep your shoulders rolled back.

They are associated with distress and diminished capacity to engage in the ordinary activities of daily life. Mental illnesses fall along a continuum of severity: some are fairly mild and only interfere with some aspects of life, such as certain phobias. On the other end of the spectrum lie serious mental illnesses, which result in major functional impairment and interference with daily life. These include such disorders as major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and may require that the person receives care in a hospital. It is important to know that mental illnesses are medical conditions that have nothing to do with a persons character, intelligence, or willpower. Just as diabetes is a disorder of the pancreas, mental illness is a medical condition due to the brains biology. Similarly to how one would treat diabetes with medication and insulin, mental illness is treatable with a combination of medication and social support. These treatments are highly effective, with 70-90 percent of individuals receiving treatment experiencing a reduction in symptoms and an improved quality of life. With the proper treatment, it is very possible for a person with mental illness to be independent and successful.", "Intent: fact-9\nQuestion: Who does mental illness affect?\n\nResponse: It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness. Mental illness does not discriminate; it can affect anyone, regardless of gender, age, income, social status, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or background. Although mental illness can affect anyone, certain conditions may be more common in different populations. For instance, eating disorders tend to occur more often in females, while disorders such as attention deficithyperactivity disorder is more prevalent in children. Additionally, all ages are susceptible, but the young and the old are especially vulnerable. Mental illnesses usually strike individuals in the prime of their lives, with 75 percent of mental health conditions developing by the age of 24. This makes identification and treatment of mental disorders particularly difficult, because the normal personality and behavioral changes of adolescence may mask symptoms of a mental health condition. Parents and caretakers should be aware of this fact, and take notice of changes in their child\u00c3\u00e2\u00e2s mood, personality, personal habits, and social withdrawal. When these occur in children under 18, they are referred to as serious emotional disturbances (SEDs).", "Intent: fact-10\nQuestion: What causes mental illness?\n\nResponse: It is estimated that mental illness affects 1 in 5 adults in America, and that 1 in 24 adults have a serious mental illness.

He or she should be able to answer questions such as: 1. What is the medication supposed to do? 2. When should it begin to take effect, and how will I know when it is effective? 3. How is the medication taken and for how long? What food, drinks, other medicines, and activities should be avoided while taking this medication? 4.

Stress is related to the same fight, flight, or freeze response as anxiety, and the physical sensations of anxiety and stress may be very similar. The cause of stress and anxiety are usually different, however. Stress focuses on mainly external pressures on us that were finding hard to cope with. When we are stressed, we usually know what were stressed about, and the symptoms of stress typically disappear after the stressful situation is over. Anxiety, on the other hand, isnt always as easy to figure out. Anxiety focuses on worries or fears about things that could threaten us, as well as anxiety about the anxiety itself.

For the last 7 months or so I was totally convinced I had some sort of cancer. It all started when noticed a swollen lymph node on the side of my neck. The lymph node had been swollen for about 2 years and i never thought anything of it until i went to ol Dr Google.

I got so obsessed with cancer that I started going to dermatology clinics because I was convinced that some of my moles looked suspicious (of course they were fine). I mean, I worked outside a lot without sunscreen and a permanently swollen lymph node is unusual, so I guess I was right to be somewhat concerned. However, I really blew it all out of proportion for a long time and despite all evidence pointing to being healthy, I cannot shake this sense of impending doom that Ive had for the last 7 months.

And people having to get their legs amputated of they didnt die already. And like if you have any open wounds or anything you can get it from that too. And basically just making it seem like youre gonna get it just by existing and having periods. Like what if i have some kind of injury from shaving or something i dont even know about?? Am i gonna get this illness just from having a period? Im an athlete and all too, its really hard to use just pads (apparently you can get it still anyways).

He assumed that its something Ive always had but only noticed now, but thats impossible because for the past year I have been obsessively checking my pupils in the mirror to make sure i havent had a stroke (hello health anxiety). a few days before the uneven pupils, I woke up with a painful pulled muscle on the left side of my neck, could that be related? I also have occasional tinnitus in the left ear, usually pulsatile (rushing noise). Im afraid its either a carotid dissectionstroke, or some sort of tumor.

Today I was feeling around my neck and noticed my right lymph node was very swollen and the left side I couldnt even feel.

Ive been lactose intolerant since I was 20, and got diagosed with GERD as a child. However I just recently did a dumb thing and looked up symptoms of celiac disease and am rationalizing going to the doctor and getting tested. No one else in my family, even extended, has had lactose or acid problems. Eating gluten with celiacs long term can cause those problems. Ive always been underweight (511, 130 lbs).

When I have more than 3 drinks in a night, I have severe vomiting the next day to the point Ive gone to the ER because it had been every hour, for 8ish hours. For someone this anxious about it, youd think Id track these things better. But now Im locked into a very shitty vegetarian diet at work chock-full of products with gluten for the next 5 months.

A few months ago, I (starving, dehydrated, anxious, overworked uni student) was sitting in my school before a class when suddenly this weird curvy shape appeared in my vision, specifically in my left eye. Kinda like if you stare at a light too long and youre left with a retinal image for a bit, except this was kinda flashing and obscured my vision. This weird episode lasted for about 30 mins, and occurred again three weeks after that, and again a week after that. Thanks to the internet (and my mom, who says she has a history of these in her past), I self diagnosed myself with visual migraines (which can present themselves with no pain, as my episodes did). At the time I took this as a call from higher powers (aka my brain?) that I needed to get more sleep, drink more water, eat better, etc. and I hadnt had an episode for two months. Well I just had another one of these episodes, and although today happened to be a very bad eating day and I was super dehydrated, Im starting to worry about these. What if I have a brain tumor?

It was after hours so my local GP (doctors surgery) was closed, meaning the next best thing was the ER..i heard about this deadly flu going around and got my ass straight to the ER as soon as i started feeling this. They did heart monitoring and blood sample as well as a chest x ray and said everything was clear and that it must just be an infection. I was prescribed amoxicillin (500mg) 4 a day, spread out evenly. I feel better in the sense that my chest isnt as breathless and my nose isnt as stuffy and im generally perkier but the chest pain is still there and im worried about it.

Now Ive convinced myself that someone came into contact with a dead, rabid animal, didnt wash their hands, and smeared whatever gunk they picked up from the hypothetical animal onto the dollar bill that I touched.

Just looking for possibilities I guess, heres what happened: Im preparing to move by putting stuff into boxes, today I focused on decorations such as figurines around the house, military memorabilia, books, and small miscellaneous items. The only thing out of the ordinary was an old roommates uniform that moved out like 6 months ago that was sitting under where I put my motorcycle helmet, I picked it up and unfurled it, saw it was his put it in my roommates pile of stuff. About 45 minutes later (give or take) my arms became itchy, incredibly itchy. When I looked at it it looked like a rash all on one side of my forearm (basically exactly where the uniform touched) and then a couple of welt like spots a bit away. I washed my arms but a little bit after I was itchy on the middle of my back, shoulder, upper thighs, calves, ankles, chest, and stomach. I hopped immediately in the shower and changed clothes.

I mentioned in my previous post that I have a very oily scalp and a lot of dandruff on my hair and as a result I have bald patches. Some people recommend me to see the doctor for second opinion so I visited another dermatologist today. She was able to diagnose my problem. She said I have a very severe hair loss at a very early age (Im only 17). The problem she mentioned was androgenic alopecia. She said normally this problem is caused because of genetics but since none of my family members are bald its probably due to an harmonal imbalance.

Ive never gotten the flu. I havent gotten the shot in a few years too, I believe.

About months ago I fell and landed on my hip. I stayed down for a minute or two only because I didnt think it would be a good idea to get up immediately, but then I got up and was fine. It was sore that night, but that was about it. The swelling started that night, too. Maybe a week and a half later, I went to the doctor about it. He didnt do any x-rays, but he felt around and tested my range of motion. My range of motion was fine and I didnt have any pain, and he said everything felt like normal swelling. He said it looked like the normal response to a fall, and that swelling can take 5 weeks to heal I think. So here I am, 17 weeks later, and my hip is still swollen.

I went to a specialist and he couldnt put a diagnose, tested me for some anti-immune stuff which came out fine.

Felt ok the first couple doses but I noticed on the 3rd dose I felt kind of light headed and fuzzy. Took my 4th dose around 10 and about an hour ago got up from the couch and was really dizzy. It seems like its a bit better now, Im not dizzy while sitting anymore. But I googled and started freaking out, some sites say dizziness is a common side effect and some say severe dizziness can be a sign of an allergic reaction. So I started freaking out even more and now I feel like my throat is closing up. I can drink water though, and breathe, so Im hoping that part is just my anxiety making everything worse. Im going to call the doctors office in the morning to see if I can have a different antibiotic, but of course its the middle of the night. Any advice or reassurance would be appreciated....", "Health Anxiety Experience: Headache after workout I had a great day and spent an hour of walking on the treadmill. Had a light meal afterwards and then I started to feel numbness on my right side (a reoccurring feeling from when i was in a minor accident) and now a headache.

Im worried about a pain in my middle back that comes and goes almost every week. Its a weird pain, specifically located in the left side of my back. It isnt an horrible pain, but its really annoying sometimes. Sometimes when I lay down the pain gets better, but its noticeable when im sitting or standing I dont know if its something related to my posture, spine, nerves... But Im really worried that could be something related to my stomach (like an ulcer) or my pancreas... I dont have any other symptoms, but my anxious mind thinks the worst.

Im currently a 24 year old female with lots of manageable chronic issues. This requires a lot of blood tests. Every time I have to get one, I get really freaked out to the point of causing fights with loved ones and raising my blood pressure with constant anxiety attacks. Im afraid I may pass or during blood tests, and passing out is one of my biggest fears. Hearing about how its really not harmful and Ill be fine once I wake up is unhelpful. Its a trigger for me. And heres the thing: I have never passed out, only gotten slightly woozy. Every time its better than I imagine it being.

Hi Im already anxious about some things but now Im really anxious because I got a few hickeys last night and one of them is really long and runs for about 2-3 inches down my neck.

I was minding my own buisness last night and heading to bed when a sudden pain took over the left side of my forehead. Lasted all of about 10 seconds and was abrupt, but it did make me go Ow! internally. The throbbing continued for around 20 or so seconds afterward. The event, however, left me feeling mentally discombobulated. I felt so spacy and out of it when moments earlier I had clarity. Derealization galore, feeling like I wasnt myself or in my own body. I was also very sleepy, so I fell asleep moments later. Today, I have pain, but only behind my left eye. Sure enough, Doc Google says that this is an aneurysm and impending death is imminent. I cant tell if I have a dilated eye just by looking at it, but one pupil is larger than the other (although this isnt much of the case when I take a pic with flash on it). The pain behind my left eye is more of a nusance than anything extreme. Id think that oned know when something this serious was about to erupt, no? Thats the scary thing about things like this.

So this poor journalist lady whos very popular in my country died of a heart attack few days ago and the news went crazy. Of course it triggered me anxiety, as always when I hear of someone else dying. She was 50 and from what I heard she was a healthy and active woman ( this makes me even more anxious knowing that no matter how healthy you try to be you still can get a heart attack) . Apparently, she was having a heavy stomach ache and went to doc. She stayed hospitalised and suffered a heart attack during endoscopy procedure. They say that maybe there was smth wrong with the anaesthesia, Weird bc its one of the best private clinics there.

Its worth mentioning that her fathers a doctor and she knew a lot about medicine and she didnt seem concerned during her stay", "Health Anxiety Experience: Is it just me, or does merely learning about the body trigger some anxiety? Ive just started taking a general biology class at uni. My professor is a microbiologist, so he knows a lot about infectious diseases and virus. Hes somewhat informal, so he often goes on tangents about various diseases hes familiar with. It always scares the crap out of me!

Im so desperate for relief that I started going to a chiropractor, which Ive always been skeptical of as a profession. The chiropractor said x-rays show my spine is very rigid and doesnt bend like it should when I look straight up, so he thinks my cervical joints are the problem. My neck feels worse two days later after he used a chiropractic activator on my cervical spine (no twisting or cracking, its a kinetic energy thing that looks like a glue gun). Im terrified of getting a dissection of the arteries in my neck and having a stroke. But the medical literature shows that cervical dissections are rare, and my family and friends who have had benefits from chiros are encouraging me to see through a few more sessions.", "Health Anxiety Experience: I feel like my health anxiety is turning into depression Can anyone relate?

I have had it in the past and I usually dont freak out. And I didnt this season either until my best friend brought up how surprised he was that I wasnt freaking out about the flu which lead me to googling everything and seeing news articles I wish I could unsee.

Lemme check my strength to make sure I am not getting ALS Feel kinda weak today. Definitely cancer and not exhaustion from 9 hours of work. Thats the second time Ive had diarrhea this week- probably cancer and not my IBS. Feeling a bit chilled; Ill be dead by tomorrow. Likely cancer. Havent I already had a cold this year? Two in one year must be cancer. Shit lemme check my pulse again... Sore shoulders? Cancer from that sunburn I got 15 years ago probably. Slight cough? Definitely cancer from second hand smoke. These may sound silly but are things that have gone through my head, obsessively, for years. I get blood work done every year and it always comes back outstanding.

Im beginning to think that it is this self consciousness and overly attachment that I have developed and reinforced over the years which has led to this becoming a persistent problem. I have a consistent HA of rabies and hence Im super aware of all the potential causes that could transmit the virus to me.

It showed just a mild gastritis, nothing to explain my severe constant pain. Ive been taking treatment but there is absolutely no difference. Doctor ordered a CT scan and I was hesitant but after some sleepless nights I decided to go for it. Well the result came right now and there isnt much wrong, just a fatty liver and some benign stuff with my prostate. Now I am sad Ive irradiated myself for nothing (although, I dont really regret it, never had such pain in my life). The risk is like a 0,2 increase in cancer but some believe the risk might be a little overestimated for CT scans. I will never accept another CT scan in my life, unless its an emergency. All doctors said abdominal CT scans are better than MRIs so thats why I didnt get an MRI. How do I get past this? I still have the pain and no diagnosis and I increased my risk of cancer.

Ive had a number of scares in the past year since Ive identified my health anxiety.

Ive also had some trouble sleeping and Ive been nauseous, had a funky appetite, and some questionable poops.

Physical health I am satisfied with even though I have slightly more fat than what I desire on my body. Regardless of these things I seem to be feeling well yet throughout some of my days in the week I feel anxious about something and I always get the feeling that its regarding one of the three things I mentioned earlier (mental, emotional, and physical). More often than ever I feel like the problem might be anxiety. Im not sure how to deal with it or what preventative measures I can take. Id much rather read or listen to people who have been going through the same scenario as me than to approach a health councilor. Any sort of feedback on the things that I can do or maybe even some controversial practices I can try would be of great help.. hopefully Thanks guys and gals! P.S.

Was mis-diagnosed at first as a hernia, went to doc and they said if i threw up, go right to er. Next morning, threw up 3 times (from anxiety probably), went to ER. They poked me, said these are swollen lymph nodes, better order some tests. So, I got bloodwork, a CT Scan and an ultrasound. Lymphoma, or another cancer is my ultimate fear. Everything came back normal. Just two enflamed lymph nodes on the CT Scan. They diagnosed it a probable bacterial infection, maybe given to me by the cat I got a week before all of this started. Gave me antibiotics. So I am about two weeks out from that, finished my antibiotics and the nodes are still the same size. Have been to GP twice since the ER, thinking I felt more nodes, he said all seems normal, and it could take a month for the nodes to go down, and they may never go down. He says he doesnt think I have lymphoma and is almost convinced fully of it. Made the mistake of reading that only a biopsy can detect cancer, so have now convinced myself I have cancer somehow, despite 3 ER docs and a nurse telling me it probably wasnt. The nodes are still about the same size, maybe bigger, but not by much.

Im wearing a brace and taking pain medicine and using iceheat. Elevating it when I can. Even while sleeping. When it popped out of place, it started swelling up, and the swelling went away about 48 hours later. Now its still a sharp pain and often feels if its going to buckle when I walk too fast or the wrong way. I cant fully bend it because it feels tight and like the muscles or tendons are twisting up. And the pretty bad sharp pain when I apply full pressure is on the middle of my knee. Im just scared and I cant afford the dr. We dont have insurance.. I cant be hurt now..

I feel relief when I scratch until I scratch so much that I tear the skin and it begins to hurt and bleed. When Im scratching I notice that Im usually holding my breath and my body is tense.

My doctor immediately ordered an ultrasound, and this morning I got a really somber call from a nurse at the Dr.s office saying I needed to see an ENT right away: I not only have the one, but multiple enlarged lymph nodes in that area. My understanding is that the concern from my doctor is not just that there are multilple and theyre enlarged (at least one is on the order of 2cm), but that at least one has persisted for so long, and even more alarming, I have no signs of an infection and my bloodwork is clean; apparently persistent enlarged, multiple lymph nodes with clean bloodwork is not a good sign.

Yes I know in 90 the immune system clears it, in the rest of the cases, you are as good as dead. There is no cure, there is no test and Im positive Im headed for cancer. I tried doctors, GPs, ENTs, CBT therapists, alternative therapists, nothing works for me. My life is practically over. I considered to start taking AHCC pills which women (and some preliminary trial) claim can help clear HPV faster just in case I did contract it (I can never know).", "Health Anxiety Experience: Healthy Foods Items It is a website link, I want to ask you it should be right or not??? http:beautysign.cfhealthy-foods-items", "Health Anxiety Experience: Rabies Anxiety Ive had a series of hypochondriac scares over the past few years, but most recently Ive been concerned about rabies. About ten days ago I let my indoor cat out in the backyard to sun herself and I caught her hissing at (what I think is) a neighbors cat that had jumped over the fence. I didnt want them to get in a fight so I shood the other cat away and waited outside for my cat to calm down. After about ten minutes I picked up my cat to bring her inside and she freaked out and bit me. Since then, the though that she might have given me rabies has been constantly on my mind, causing a great deal of anxiety. I know that my cat is vaccinated (she was given a 3 year booster 2 and 12 years ago) and the neighbor cat was not rabid. I know that rabies, especially from cat to humans, is very rare in the US. I know that Im being absolutely ridiculous, but knowing that doesnt help. I keep thinking maybe the booster wore off prematurely, or the neighbor cat did have rabies and my cat bit her before biting me. It doesnt help that I woke up today with a headache and a sore throat, two early symptoms of rabies, and that Ive been having nightmares where I loose my mind and become aggressive. Im not sure exactly what to do about this or what this post is supposed to do. Im on lexapro for general anxiety and OCD tendencies.

Eventually the pill cracked open from sitting in water for too long and I went ahead and swallowed about less than 13 of the little beads inside the capsule. I hear its dangerous to consume a pill that is crushed or broken down because it gives you large dosage at once. The good part is that I didnt swallow even half of what was inside the flomax pill.

When he examined it he found that it was coming off of breast tissue of my right breast and ordered a mammogram and ultrasound which I had Wednesday. They found three lumps in my breast (not including what is under my arm) as well as my lymph nodes being enlarged.

She showed the doctor my results and they recommended a CT Scan with Contrast and are sending me to a specialist. Ive called to try and get my results from the mammogramultra sound but they wont give them to me over the phone (which I understand). I had the CT Scan today and see the specialist Tuesday.

Finding this sub has been a huge encouragement to me as Ive realized I deal with increasingly frequent health anxiety. My current concern is with the brain eating amoeba. I spent time in a hot tub that wasnt properly chlorinated this weekend. Shortly after the hot tub, I got in the shower and ummm.. picked my nose rather vigorously. After doing so, I thought about the warm hot tub water, so I blew my nose then used saline spray to clean out my nostrils. 2 times in the last 3 days, Ive gotten really dizzy and lightheaded, feeling like I was going to fall or pass out. Today, Ive had a bad headache and have felt extra sensitive to light. No fever at this point. Allow me to think out loud: - can the amoeba even enter the brain from picking your nose? - is it possible that the amoeba would have just been in my nostril, then I helped it further up towards the brain with the stream of saline solution? - would a headache associated with the amoeba come and go or be constantprogressively worse?

A few weeks ago he was convinced he had ALS because of muscle twinges. Last night he shared with me that hes terrified he has liver disease as a result of how much he used to drink in college. He gets down this long rabbit hole of searching through the internet and it drives me crazy because its not helping anything. And he refuses to get tested for anything because he doesnt want it to be confirmed true. He has generalized anxiety on occasion and has started to go to a therapist but still hasnt talked about these types of things with the therapist, which drives me crazy. Were in our mid-twenties, live in a metropolitan area, and live a pretty healthy lifestyle, going to the gym frequently and eating semi-healthy. Im thinking about blocking sites like Mayo Clinic and webMD so he cant search at home but I dont know if thats a mean thing to do.

I finally got to the doctor for my annual physical and that was a nice victory in itself. Unfortunately my blood work came back with low platelets and elevated liver enzymes. My doctor had me get retested and those numbers came back today -- and theyre worse, so now Im going in for an ultrasound and more testing to rule out hepatitis. I cant stop shaking and crying. Im so scared! Its probably going to be nothing but I cant stop thinking about all the serious things it could be. Im taking care of it with my doctor, but I really could just use 100000 hugs right now. And some chocolate.

I want to be with him and by his side, but my anxiety is through the roof about it. Im going to go because he needs my support but does anyone have any advice or coping skills to help me get through this? He might be there for multiple days and that thought is ruining me.

So, last August I found a lump, I had a CT, an op to remove my left testicle and then on 02 October was officially diagnosed with Stage 2a Testicular Cancer. Since then Ive had Chemo, Radiotherapy and as of a few weeks ago my first Scans are normal meeting with the Onco. Hooray! That said, the health anxiety Im experiencing is taking the piss. Every little ache, twitch, twinge, anything makes me worry unnecessarily. As a result of the Radiotherapy my guts have been a bit iffy since, but a recent toothache caused me to take a lot of Ibuprofen, which together with the Radiotherapy caused me some really dire constipation. This lead to a hemorrhoid. Its internal and normally I cant feel it unless Ive sat on something cold in which case it throbs for a few minutes and then stops. Occasionally theres a spot or two of blood on my crap, and one occasion I had such a large bowel movement that it turned the toilet water bright, bright red, but otherwise my bms are consistent size, shape, colour and bloodless - they just scratch a little as they pass. Im improving my diet to include more fibre so hopefully itll sort itself out. Right now I want to concentrate on the future.

I had a big episode where I thought I was dying of an aneurysm, and went to the doctor and all that and figured out that it was not the case, so Ive been through all that, but I still cant help this nagging feeling of WTF IS IT THEN?? Initially I theorized that it must be my headphones causing it (headband is too tight), because the pain seems to be coming from muscles on the outside of skull, as shown by how when I massage it the pain temporarily suppresses. So I switched to in-ear buds exclusively, and the pain went away for awhile. I thought I had won... but now its back! AGH. Why? And now that Ive ruled out headphones as the cause, I am freaking out again. Constantly thinking it must be something fatal.

After this, me as a person suffering from anxiety, got to live with this fear, that there might be something in me, that i might not be aware of.

I went to the ER and got a ekg(normal), heart attack blood marker test(normal), and a chest xray(normal). While I was there I found out the funny heartbeats were ectopic beats. My primary care sent me for hotter monitor(confirmed benign ectopic beats), stress test(normal), and echocardiogram(normal). This still wasnt good enough for me so I asked to have a CT angiogram to make sure I had no blockages. This came back clear. I had a couple good weeks and was getting good at ignoring my funny heart beats and then just days ago I started to focus on odd feelings in my left chest almost under my armpit. No sweat, shortness of breath or any other symptoms. So I went to the Emergency room and of course everything normal. No matter how many times I tell my self to calm down everything is alright.

Hi all, Like a lot of people with h.a., my biggest fear is having a brain tumor. So, Ive had some weird vision things for the past year and Ive been to an opthalmologist twice (because the first time wasnt enough apparently). I sometimes see glittery floaters or what appears to be a quick line through my vision. Also, I sometimes have funky peripheral sparkles. My opthalmologist performed intensive tests and said my eyes look extremely healthy. I think Im seeing these things because of my anxiety and stress of my life as a college student. Its just very concerning it doesnt seem to go away... But the doc probably knows best. Also commonly, headaches are pretty common... Finally, maybe once a year Ill have an ocular migraine where I get some weird vision tricks and my lips and fingers seem numb. Although these are probably nothing major Ive been wanting to get an MRI just to be sure. Mother thinks most of this is caused by me over committing to activities and my academic stress in college but some of these symptoms seem so real its hard to not think its a neuroloical issue.

Now Im going once or sometimes even twice a day, compared to my usual routine of once in two days.

Ive been sick for awhile with a diagnosed but generally not serious sinus infection, but lately Ive been noticing some other things (which I wont mention so you dont fall down the same hole Im in) and those things of course led me to the worst possible idea: Googling my symptoms.

Even though I went to my general practitioner for the sinus infection today and mentioned the other strange symptom, I didnt mention the name of the specific thing I think I could have because it felt ridiculous and the symptoms were subsiding.

However, I cant get my mind off the idea that because my viral symptoms have worsened, the virus is attacking my heart and I now have myocarditis. Is it worth going to ER again for an ECG and cardiac troponins to put my mind at ease? Ive been reading reports over at the myocarditis foundation website and what strikes me as particularly terrifying about this disease is its tendency to randomly cause sudden death without prior warning.

Anyway my latest worries are that I seem to feel like Im struggling for breath at times and having random heart palpitations. This is one of those situations where as a sufferer of health anxiety your brain puts you on the spot and you have to make a decision. Do you A: write it off as anxiety and try your best to get on with life. B: jump to a conclusion that you are probably dying and seek medical advise. Guess what I did. After the doctor listened to my heart and lungs and said it sounds fine but well Do some blood work as I hadnt had any in a while and an ECG just to be sure. So I spent all Christmas worrying that Im dying of a serious lung or heart problem and today the day finally came for the blood test and ECG. Now even the thought of blood work makes me feel sick. I layed on the bed and had the ECG done and when it came to the blood test she stuck the needle in and I had a panic attack and she couldnt get the blood from me. I am so embarrassed and ashamed of myself I cant remember feeling any lower. I tried to hard and iv been worrying about this whole thing for quite a while. Now Im convinced Im gonna get a phone call saying to immediately come in because I have a serious condition.

(Quick background: Ive had health anxiety since my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer, and its gone through the roof in the year amp; a half since she died.) A year ago my doctor discovered a small polyp on my gallbladder. It was only 3mm, but he decided to monitor it anyway just in case, which means an ultrasound every 6 months for 2 years. During my second ultrasound, the polyp was a little bigger -- this time, 4mm -- and my doctor seemed worried. But he seems like he gets worried easily, so I dont really know how I should feel... My moms gallbladder was removed for a variety of reasons at 45, and it turned out hers had precancerous cells (cells that look a bit off and may develop into cancer). So my family history has me worried. Im also concerned because (a) its a single polyp, and single polyps are more likely to be cancerous, and (b) its growing, albeit slowly. I keep trying to tell myself that Im young (mid-twenties) and that gallbladder cancer is EXTREMELY unlikely in anyone under 40, but I cant shrug this awful feeling. Gallbladder cancer kills 85 of people within 5 years (though most people are diagnosed late-stage, so who knows what my odds would be if I actually had it). My next ultrasound is in a few weeks, and my anxiety levels are ridiculous. How do you guys find some peace when you have a test coming up?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Chest Pain Hi, Im hoping you lovely people can help me with this.

Over this period I got 3 blood tests, a stool sample, 2 (abdominal) CTs (where you could see a bit of my chest), and a chest x-ray. Nothing came back positive. Eventually I started feeling better and started going on with my life. What may be somewhat important information is that my dad is a surgeon and I work reception for him, he had similar problems a few weeks before me. For the last few days, Ive had some loose-ish stools, a bit of weaknessfatigue, but mainly Im concerned about a dull pain that moves around my chest. Today its mostly been on my left side and about 30 min ago went into my left shoulder. Its not constant and it can be lower right, upper left, whatever.

Went to a gay bar yesterday with friends at about 4am last night, around closing time. My friends kind of separated from me, trying to pursue a bartender. I sat at the bar looking at my phone, when another person who was there started talking to me. I didnt mind at first but then I noticed he was drunk. I, being horrible at small talk, decided to compliment his teeth. I SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE THIS because he then complimented mine, and grabbed my face in an effort to open my mouth to see my teeth. Luckily he didnt get his fingers on or in my mouth, but his hands were all over my lower jaw. I struggled to remove his hands off of me, and then that asshole pushed me away. This person was a male probably in his mid 50s. On top of feeling like my personal space was totally violated, I have been worried sick about any germs or viruses that could have been on his hands.

Sleeping is so god damn difficult. The dermatologist said that these things can go deep which scared the shit out of me.

Im a 24 year old male. 2 years ago I started having symptoms described below and it would come and go every couple months.

The only symptom I have is the feeling of my food not being digested after eating and being full for hours and hours after eating. I have ZERO appetite. And also after eating my gut gets very gurgle and makes lots of noises. Ill even workout twice a day and fast till dinner and still have zero appetite. I usually consume 400-600 mg of caffeine wether its multiple cups of coffee, tea or pre workout so I dont know if that is bad. My anxiety has been very high worrying about stomach cancer.

I got a new cat about 3 months ago, and shes a community stray from kind of the outskirts of Philadelphia. Shes about 9 months old now and very rambunctious, and quite a cutie. However, as she is rambunctious I somehow started looking into whether or not she could have rabies. She runs around like crazy, rolls around a lot, and loves biting me. Like, LOVES biting me. Definitely drawn blood a few times, no infections due to careful cleaning after. I read that rabies usually shows 2-3 months after infection, and upwards of a year, so theoretically if she was bitten before I got her (shes 100 an indoor cat now) she could start showing symptoms. Is it at all possible, or am I being a doof? Also, should mention, got her all of her shots after taking her in. Not sure if that matters for rabies.

Currently have a rough bout with getting over the thought that I may have lung cancer. I am a non-smoker but I constantly am checking my phlegm to see if there is a little bit of blood. I do find very little bits some time but I am sure this is because of my obsessive checking. Been to doctor and had an x-ray but these always seem like bandaids as the feeling comes back after weeks. I have been to a therapist and tried doing CBT but I find that my HA can quickly snowball if I do not nip it in the bud early on. Kind of where I feel I am at right now.

So this past weekend I went to a college reunion with people I hadnt seen in 7 years. We went out one night and a friend asked if I smoked, I said no. He handed me his vape and said try this. I did, and hit it a few more times through out the night. Well at the end of the reunion weekend he revealed to a friend that he had been HIV for several years and currently has his virus controlled and undetectable. But needless to say it was a very stressful drive home. I had one of the worst HA freak outs I have had in years and didnt eat for 48 hours I was so nervous. I could hardly get out of bed!

I was diagnosed with brain aneurysm and artery dissections when I was 22, which put me at stroke risk until I was fully healed (which I am now). I will post the full story in the comments. It seems that for some of you on here, that is literally your worst fear, Im here to tell you that even if it does happen, an aneurysm or even a stroke is not a death sentence. In fact, I was healed (with no surgery) within 3 months. The aneurysm had been there for at least 2 months before that and I had no idea, AND I STILL LIVED! The most debilitating part of this? The HA I got from it. It was the darkest 6 months of my life. I was in constant fear of having a stroke despite the blood thinners I was on. I never wanted to be alone anywhere and only felt truly safe with my parents. I had panic attacks all the time. But slowly, I gained more confidence in the functioning abilities of my body.

It has become a lot better over the years and I have found ways to cope and calm myself down. Im not the HA-type that goes to doctors a lot - actually almost never - partly because my rational part knows that its just HA and partly because its so crazy expensive. My main tools for managing HA has been act normal (even if I feel worried and obsess, do not take action - dont look for reassurance, dont see a doctor, dont google - dont feed the monster), setting a specific time when its ok to worry (between 6-7 at night, worry time. At other times, just postpone it.) and writing down what I worry about. Its been going well for the last few years and I almost considered myself cured. Until I decided to go for an extensive health check with a battery of tests. Theres no particular symptom that brought on this, just that its something I should start doing regularly at my age. What normal people do. However, as soon as I booked the test and got the list of tests, HA totally exploded. In a way worse than the usual HA where I used to focus on just a few illnesses - now I basically convinced that with that many tests and possible cancers, I must check positive for at least one! Has anyone else experience this kind of setback and how did you cope? I still have two-three more weeks before the results.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Does anyone want to be reassurance buddies?

Anyways, I go to the gym today like any other normal day, come home to shower and its....not there? I cracked my shoulder at the gym but nothing else out of the ordinary (I did work shoulders) and its just not sticking out like it did, and Im thoroughly confused and quite honestly anxious for no reason at all. I have been dealing with a shoulder injury for as long as I can remember as well. Where did it go? Was it not a lymph node then? Its still the slightest bit asymmetrical from my right armpit, but not like usual. Was it likely not even a lymph node then? Ive been told that if it remained unchanged for so long (14 months from noticing it) that its either unlikely a lymph node or just a shotty one.

How are people with HA suppose to cope with their disorders when there are constant stories about young adults getting rare cancers and reading articles that say certain cancers such as bowelcolon and brain cancers are increasing.

Im an otherwise healthy 20 yo female and last week my legs started feeling very itchy. Then, the itching moved upwards to my torso and arms. On wednesday I noticed two strange rashes on my arms and decided to see a doctor because the itching was just horrible. He said its probably an allergy and that he cant do much until i figure out at least if its food or something enviromental causing the problem, and he gave me allergy pills to ease my itching and rashes. He said to take two if the rashes reappear. So the next day, when I got another one on my arm, I took just one pill, and they stopped appearing. The next day, I took one more just to be sure and the itching and rashes were totally gone by friday. Now, the problem is, on friday I thought my breathing was a bit more labored than usual.

Its on the lining of the cheek in a weird sort of muscular pocket that moves when you move your jaw, hence the pain. Would cancer grow this quickly? Im quite sure this lump wasnt there before.

Historically, for me.. January-March is the hardest time for year for me. My Anxiety journey began two years ago, in February. One of my best friends passed from a Brain Tumor, the month before. I went to his funeral and they talked about all the symptoms he had.... next thing I know, Im consumed by constantly looking for the same symptoms. Then they start to appear.... One day, Im fine. The next day I have a pain in my neck and googled it and was convinced it was cancer and I was going to die and leave my young wife and daughter.

Just wondering how many people here have had their eyelids twitching for many months (or longer)? If you finally got it to go away, what did you do? I see a lot of posts where people are stressing about eyelids twitches theyve had for days or weeks (or sometimes hours). But mine have twitched to varying degrees since last May or so. I have tried several bouts of destressing, improving my sleep, meditating, exercising, eating bananas, drinking tonic water, taking multivitamins, ... but cant seem to get them to stop twitching. I also notice if I blink hard, sneeze, look certain directions, etc that theyll start twitching. If I partially close my eyes then the muscles around my eyes quiver like theyre straining to hold the position. Which leads me down the path of thinking its more than stress  anxiety and something more in my muscles or nervous system.

Its even gotten to the point where I will unconsciously make myself breathe lighter, even when not doing any physical activity, just so I cant hear myself breathing (I guess my brain associates audible breathing with physical exertion??).

They did a chest x-ray, EKG, and blood work. In the end, I was told that I had a spot on my lung and a slight irregularity in the EKG. Blood work was all fine. It was suggested I follow up with a cardiologist for an echocardiogram and 24-hour holter monitor and a radiologist for the CT. I had the CT scan done last Friday and it was a calcification in the lung (probably from a childhood of asthma, bronchitis, and pleurisy). No big deal. However, the palpitations had worsened to the point I couldnt sleep on Thursday (theyre at their worst when I try to sleep). I spoke to the cardiologist and he suggested magnesium which has helped calm it down I think. However, Ive now developed a cough which has been worsening over the last few days. I went in to the cardiologist this morning to get the 24 hour EKG put on and drop off the CT scan results and, just an hour after, the nurse called and asked if I would be okay to move my appointment from next Monday to this Friday at 9 am. I am completely freaked out that there is something really wrong--especially since the appointment was moved up.

Ive come to the conclusion that perhaps the only thing I think would put my mind to rest is reaching out to my ex ( who I had the unprotected sex with) himself. The thing is I havent talked to him in over a year and have no idea how I would go about talking about this to him. But if an awkward conversation is the price I have to pay for my sanity and control of my life back then I have to do it. How do you suggest I go about this? Do I go straight to the point? Id suggest him to get tested for confirmation. Please, any advice would mean the world.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Cant stop worrying about oral cancer I am a 20 year old and I have pretty bad HA Ive had it under control for a little while now until recently when I felt a few little lumps on my gums at first I thought maybe its a canker sore or something but my anxiety got the best of me when I saw an ad about oral cancer and it kicked my into the deep end. Now I dont know how long they were there so it was just recently I discovered it but I thought for sure that I had oral cancer. I called my dentist asked for him to check it out just to be safe he said ok. I went in today got a couple of x rays than he looked in my mouth with the mirror thing he said Your x rays came back good and I dont see anything wrong it looks like it might be just bit of extra bone but you have nothing to worry about. for some reason my anxiety wont let me accept that. I have been trying everything to accept hat my dentist said but for my anxiety tells me Maybe he missed it? Now have been trying everything I can to get my HA back under control but I know its going to be incredibly difficult. So I would like to know if you have any advice that can help me I would like to hear it.", "Health Anxiety Experience: Toenail Melanoma? This sounds so stupid, but Im worried about toenail melanoma. I recently removed my nail polish and noticed that on one of my toenails, a little less than half of it is a light brown color. The pigment starts from the edge of the nail so its not a sole brown line. It just looks like half of my nail lengthwise is a darker shade. For reference I am under 30 and darker-skinned, and Im fairly sure Ive had this pigmentation for awhile and its been noticed by my derm, but since Ive had my nails painted Im worried that somehow it changed or it looks different than I remember. I know its more common on the thumbs, index fingers, big toes - and its not on either of those. My two pinky toenails also currently have some brown pigmentation basically covering the whole nail. In all three toenails have some funky darker pigmentation going on right now. Admittedly this has been the first time Ive cut my toenails in a little over a month so they were long. I also tend to wear heels frequently so Im not sure if this pigmentation is more trauma based? Ive been to the derm a few times in the past year for cancermole related concerns so Id hate to keep going back.

Ive been struggling with medical issues for a while now that are definitely exaggerated by health anxiety which has been hard in many ways. Mainly because I never know when Im experiencing a real symptom or my anxiety is just getting the best of me. My doc wanted me to see a neurologist who ordered an MRI. I missed the call last night with what I thought would be results which left me waiting all night. I was so ready to call this morning and have my anxiety put to ease but all they said was the results were not specific enough and the neurologist wants to see them himself. So that brings me to now, about 10 am. At 11 I am planning to go grab the disk from the imaging center in my town and then bring it to drop off at my neurologist a little over an hour away.

When Im depressed, I often wake up full of anxiety, feeling like Im almost having a heart attack.

At first I thought it was an external sound, but then I pinned it down to coming from inside my head when I was in the bathroom one time. I googled it and it came up with pulsatile tinnitus, and it said the cause could be tumours, aneurysms, high blood pressure, hearing loss etc. I hear it in my right ear, and as I said its normally for around 10 seconds a day at random times. Ive been unable to trigger it or find a way to induce it; there seems to be no pattern to it. Which is odd because people who mention this talk of it being constant. I exercise regularly and do cardio, and Im cutting down on my caffeine consumption to see if that helps.

After i took a hit, I had a hard time accepting the reality of the situation, which is the key point I am making here. As I have improved with my anxiety issues over the past year, I took up smoking weed again for a while, with very little anxiety. A couple weeks ago, I smoked more than I usually did, so the set in was much more intense. Although it felt good, I noticed there was some anxiety building up in the back of my mind. I began to panic. But I decided to try just letting go, and accepting the reality of what was happening. No more anxiety, I was able to enjoy the drug.

Today was especially bad, with a pain on the right side of my back below my shoulder that was like a pulsating pain with my heart beat. It went on throughout the day and aspirin didnt help, every time I made a small adjustment Id get the pains. Then suddenly when I came home they went away, but about half an hour ago I felt a sharp pain on the left side of my back that felt like it also hurt in my chest. Ive kind of been on edge since then and have been experiencing various sharp pains in my chest. I went to the doctor today and they took my blood pressure and pulse which were normal, and the doc listened to my heart yesterday and it was fine. Would these seem off if I did have a PE?

I conitnued having these panic attacks but I understood that I wasnt having one heart attack every day so I tried convincing myself it was anxiety. I went to see a doctor after a while just to make sure nothing was wrong with me and I got a referal to the hospital to have a 24h EKG taken. I did and they noticed some extra-beats. My heart rate was also pretty high for short periods during these 24 hours for unexplained reasons. I assume anxiety. I recently got another referal to a cardiologist and I am going to do a lot of different tests to make sure that nothing is wrong. I got the referal to the cardiologist 2 weeks ago but I havent recieved a letter, phone call or anything. So who knows how long it will take? I recently started having a cough.

Behind my chin underneath my jawline, one side is more swollen than the other when I tense my neck muscles. I first discovered it when I was prodding my neck, its very pronounced when I tilt my head to the side. I tilted my head to the left, tensed my muscles and it felt like a huge mass under my jaw. I can feel a similar shape on the left side of my neck but its nowhere near as big. It looks big in the mirror too. When Im relaxed I cant feel anything. There is no pain and I havent found any lumps, but Im really starting to panic now. My mam comes back from holiday on Monday so Ill have her feel it.

However, the last time I went to my cardiologist she said that along with my MVP I also have a leakage on my pulmonary valve and a distention of the aorta in the Valsalva sinus (Im actually trying to translate my doctors note in English so there might be some mistakes). She said that I should avoid things like coffee and energy drinks and that Im okay. She also said I must go for an exam every 2 years. She didnt really explain if my symptoms are solely from anxiety however. Thats actually why Im writing this post to see if those other conditions beside MVP mentioned in my doctors note are serious because I cant get it out of my mind these days.

I opened a can of cat food and dumped it out. The offending cat was ravenous and ate a whole can in less than one minute. I fed him another can and he scarfed about half of it. Then he was happy and let me pet him. Afterward, he started cleaning himself. I began walking through my yard and he started to follow me. Then out of no where, he scratched and bit my leg through my work pants. It wasnt super hard but when I came inside, I see it slightly broke my skin.

During the last year, I have been to the doctors about this issue a few times, mentioning the almost pinching sensation that occurs. However, on none of these occasions have any follow-up appointments been scheduled, each doctor suggesting there is absolutely nothing to worry about and suggesting they could be a symptom of anxiety or tension. For a few months, it hasnt worried me as much but has been in the back of my head (quite literally!), and I decided to make another appointment for today. Again, I was told the same thing, but was prescribed with an anti-inflammatory medicine. Have any of you experienced similar symptoms, and do you have any advice? fyi, 21 year old male who has never had real issues with headachesmigraines.

I also had to get surgery to remove an ovary due to a cyst and they did all the general blood work then and everything looked fine.

It doesnt hurt or itch its just red. I went to urgent care this morning and she told me I was fine and couldnt feel my lymphnodes but to come back in three days if the rash doesnt go away.

The other is that I will randomly get sharp bursts of pain in isolated areas of my head that feel like bad headaches, but only last for like a minute or so.

If I think I might have breast cancer I automatically think it will kill me. I imagine saying my last goodbyes to my family and friends and think of all the things I will never achieve in my life because Ive died young. To reassure myself, I tell myself that Im making it up it my head, I dont have cancer, its so unlikely at my age etc. This reassurance is only fleeting before I find another symptom and the cycle continues. But lately Ive been realising that one of the main problems is that I underestimate my ability to cope with health problems. There are hundreds of thousands of cancer survivors who end up living long and happy lives. People who are HIV positive can live relatively normal lives despite their illness thanks to modern medicine. Having an illness does not mean the end of the world. By reframing my thinking when reassuring myself from I dont have x disease, Im OK to I probably dont have x disease, but if I do I know I will find a way to cope with it and I will be ok, I have found that health anxiety worries have come up less frequently as the intrusive thoughts have less to hold on to.", "Health Anxiety Experience: CWD is freaking me out My uncle likes to hunt deer here in Texas, and he sends us venison sausage from time to time after an especially successful hunting trip.

Now Im scared that its something serious. I know it could be ovulation (that got delayed) but I never had ovulation bleeding before.

Financially I cant really move until May. I take 3 different kinds of antihistamines daily, a combo inhaler, clean constantly bc of the dust, and run two air purifiers and a dehumidifier. Im still not better. Theres a vent in our bathroom maybe going to the ceiling of the upper unit bathroom and eventually out into the roof but thats it for ventilation. I think the people above have a cat and Im allergic to cats but Im not sure if the allergens can travel like that? Either way its like I have legit ocd now about dust mold and cats. Im constantly cleaning everything in an attempt to feel better and I keep getting worse. Drs give me more pills that do nothing. I think I am slowly losing it.

He denied the need to go to the ER for some time, until finally I made him call for medical help. They came, but they were unable to diagnose him, so they just gave him a pain shot and left. After this I finally made it home, and after a brief examination of his abdomen I was totally sure it was his appendix. So you could have guessed by now I have a health anxiety, and have had it all my life. And its actually severe and affects my life hugely. Almost all of my family are medics, so I know a lot, but I myself is not a doctor at all. So, I called for medical help again, and I made them take him, and I insisted on the operation, though they werent sure because my husbands symptoms were so smudged because of the drug they gave him. It was an appendicitis, the surgery was almost at the last moment before it would burst. But it was a minor surgery and after a few days he was totally fine, he just got 3 really small scars. And know my health anxiety went fully blown out on him, because it seems if I hadnt this anxiety and the knowledge it gave me, my husband could have been in a way worse situation. So Im anxious over his every headache and all. Im like a crazy mom, lol. When I think something bad can happen to him I cry, and I always fear the worst.

Im 22 and have no family history of colon cancer. Around mid January, I started having extremely large amounts of diarrhea, probably like 4-5 times a day. Within 2 weeks, I was still having diarrhea but now blood started showing up, and now every time (apart from 1-2 here and there) I have blood in my stool. Within the last week, Im still going 4-5 times a day, but half of those are usually to pass mucus and blood, nothing else. The rest of the time I still pass mucus and blood, but with normal stool. It might be stress related because collegework is pretty hectic, but I manage and I have no other stress symptoms. I went to my doctor around 2 weeks ago and he said there was nothing he can do, so he scheduled a GI appointment which is finally coming this Tuesday. The problem is that I read cancer stories from people my age, and they all say they initially got passed off by several doctors because of their age group, and they dont get the diagnosis until they finally get a colonoscopy, so I will make sure I get one.

I do not have a family history of it; Im 33 and live a very active, healthy life. But I live in almost constant fear of finding a lump and being given a death sentence.

I check myself daily during the bad HA cycles (usually tied to menstrual cycle) and in several extra dark times, have convinced myself my ribs, muscle tissue, etc. are lumps. Always to be reassured by my OB that they arent and that Im low risk and completely healthy. It makes me crazy though. Sometimes I even feel breast pain, which Im pretty sure is psychosomatic because when Im busypreoccupied I dont feel the pain. But when I obsess, I feel it constantly and live in a loop of crazy anxiety. Im driving my husband nuts and the worrying often robs me of other joys. But I dont know how to overcome this.

Im new to this sub and Reddit in general. 33F history of HA and panic disorder, but it has been fairly well controlled for the last decade. Since last fall, Ive had chest abdominal pain. Doctor thought it was GERD, but I havent responded to multiple PPIs. I recently had a full cardiology workup and it was clear. Normally cardiology tests would really excite me, but this time I honestly didnt think it was my heart. The pain is worsening and Im so discouraged. Its a constant burning and I cant find any relief with a bland diet or medicine. Endoscopy and abdominal ultrasound were normal. Im beginning to think theyll never find out whats wrong. Its almost to the point I want pain medicine, and thats not me. I do realize the impact anxiety can have, especially on the digestive system, but Im in constant pain. It feels like theres more to this. Im fearful of tests continuing to come back normal, theyll blame my anxiety and depression and Ill continue to suffer.

I feel like its gotten worse and fear that I have some sort of disease that makes my retina deteriorate, and its just gonna keep getting worse until Im blind.

I will have an arthroscopic knee debridement surgery, the procedure just needs two 4-8 mm incisions basically. Usually, patient would be discharged after a few hours of waking up or stay one night at hospital in some cases. I know in every surgery there is a chance of infection and I know that my surgery is one of the easiest surgeries available too. However, I am really afraid to get an hospital infection. I had 4 surgeries before, but the nearest one was 7 years ago when I was 17 years old. I am almost 5 inches taller(64) and 100 pounds heavier now(300lbs currently). I mean when we put all those things together, these make me anxious. To sum up: I am really scared of hospital infection even though my surgery is pretty easy and incisions will be just 8 mm max.

Are they parasitic?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Im afraid to have any tests done so I dont go to the doctor Hi, things arent going well I dont know if this is health anxiety related but I have a problem with having any tests done. Where its not health anxiety is that I know I dont live a healthy lifestyle. My cholesterol was 230 in 2015. I havent been tested since. I couldnt deal with a diagnosis. I barely make it day to day with my depression and yet Ive already diagnosed myself with type 2 diabetes, sleep apnea, Graves disease, sometimes bowel OR colon cancer (sometimes I have bloody stool), a permanent heart defect that Im convinced I have from taking too much immodium (poor mans methadone) back when I was addicted to opiates. I honestly think Im dying and Im only 30. But even though Ive been diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder, I am sure I have most of those things because my body is slowly turning itself on me. But I think Id rather die than be diagnosed with anything. I know that sounds insane but Ive battled mental health and then later addiction for most of my life.

It flashes blue in response to bright lights, sometimes it even flashes when Im laying in bed with my eyes closed. I mentioned it at my appointment, got my right eye dilated, and boom... white spot in my nerve layer. Didnt have it on my checkup 12 days prior. He said it was nothing to really worry about, but classified it as most likely being a cotton wool spot, which is usually found in people with hypertension andor diabetes.

It was the very top of my head but more towards my left side. Dont really think it caused many problems other than hurting because I was still able to fish and remember when it happened and the events after it happened (didnt blackout or whatever). Later Saturday night I felt my head and realized that it actually got cut and its looks kind of like a small raspberry-type injury about the size of a dime maybe smaller.

My pupils never became dilated and Ive just had a minor headache which could possibly be due to stressanxiety but the pressure is in my face (eyes and nose area).

Ive always had floaters in my vision and there arent any new ones, but the floaters themselves are kinda blurry now and I notice them everywhere instead of just outside.

Anyways he does some tests to see the power of my exhale (dont remember what its called) and then gives me abeuterol and tries the text again. I got the same results, but he said when he checked my breathing after the wheeze was gone. So, in short, is this shortness of breath from anxiety, or could it be a very minor case of asthma?

What do I request? My mom suggested I say that there is a history of heart attacks in my family, but Im not sure if thats necessary.

I was worried about processed MEAT only and not processed meals in general). Ive had hemorrhoid symptoms lasting over 2 months now (itching and bright red spots). Bowel habits constantly change. Lot of gas, bloating, and nausea. Feeling hungry more than usual. I had diarrhea for the first time in a month and a half last weekend, no bowel movements at all for almost 4 days.

Evident by the fact Im posting here. Whether they stay or go away in a few years, I dont care. 23, so I have all the time to wait. One thing that Ive recently noticed though is that when I almost close my eyes completely and look up at the sky during the day, I can see an entire faint sheet of what I assume is the liquid my floaters are in, and I can see the entire field of my vision is in what essentially looks like a very faint wall of bubbly protiens and crap. When my eyes are wide open its harder to see but in the sky I can still ever so slightly notice it. My question is, has anyone had this along with the more prominent floaters and did the wall eventually go away?

I rested and put ice in my groin area that night, and a week later I felt better. I ejaculated again and it looked fine, but there was a weird piece of something, it looked kind of like old dry blood, it was dark red and tiny. It happened again recently, about another week apart, and now Im freaking out. Did I injure myself really badly? Should I see a professional? Or just wait longer than I am again to heal properly?

For the past three days I only felt tingling for a few seconds in my feet and I am CONSTANTLY fearing that the symptoms will come back, like I cant go 2 minutes without thinking about it. Also since I was younger, wherever I laughed a lot( like a lot as in those cases where you laugh for minutes and almost cry ) my face goes numbshaky or trembles and the same thing happens when Im anxious sometimes, and especially after I am relieved.

Ive basically developed an anaphylaxis fear, mostly related to food, even though Ive never had a food-related reaction in my life.

This has made eating pretty much anything an incredibly stressful experience. Eating is one of my favourite things to do, especially trying new food and anxiety is even affecting that now.

Three months ago, all of a sudden felt dizzy, my heart was racing so I went to the doctor and they took blood work which came out normal and sent me to a cardiologist. Im guessing it was my first panic attack? My ekg was normal, he said he heard a heart murmur but thought I was okay and i had anxiety. He didnt even feel the need to check my heart. But I still did a 48 hour heart monitor, didnt really feel any symptoms, but it was still normal, he just said I had sinus tachycardia.

I was also walking to class upstairs and I was gasping for air and my heart was racing. The highest my heart Ive seen my heart go is 195 which doesnt sound healthy. My heart rate will also go from 50 to 100 randomly which concerns me? Yesterday morning I woke up with my heart rate at 170 so I went to the ER and my ekg was normal.

My chest seemed to relax and I was okay enough to drive home and listen to a podcast to calm down.

Ive never had chest pain with my panic attacks. A few minutes ago I started getting the chest pain again. Its been hours since it last happened. Does this sound like anxiety?

Nonetheless, on Monday when I went into work there was some little black things on my desk that I thought was dried glue from work however turned out to be mouse poo. I only picked the one bit up before being told it was mouse poo, then slid the rest onto paper towel with an aid so I didnt touch anymore with my hand directly. I then tossed it in the bin and washed my hands, I could have touched my forehead prior to washing but I cant be sure. Anywho, ever since then when I googled mouse poo originally just to see what it looked like and it lead me down a health anxiety hole so to say.

The other thing is that if I stop worrying about them, I get comfortable and attached to my lifestyle, and then if something happens, its going to be more of a letdown.

When the bones of the neck are not in proper alignment (a lordotic curve), whether from past trauma (e.g. whiplash, repetitive micro trauma), or poor posture, it can cause a bunch of symptoms that a lot of people are attributing to brain tumors (headaches, dizziness, vision issues, brain fog, fatigue etc.). A formal x-rayCTMRI report will not usually comment on an absent lordotic curve if there is nothing pathologically wrong (bone spurs, herniations etc.) with the vertebrae or disc space, but a non-lordotic curve does cause real symptoms.

I just wanted to share an article with you that really helped me and puts things in to perspective. I really hope this helps and makes things better for those of you in a similar situation. Be safe and get tested and you will be fine I promise! Life goes on and is too short to be spent worrying. Enjoy! [YOUR HONEST-TO-GOD GUIDE TO STDS](https:markmanson.netstd-guide)", "Health Anxiety Experience: Ive been just kind of denying or ignoring this problem for awhile... Occasionally I get either bright red blood in the bowl or like these weird pinkish red chunks in it. Like I ate a shredded reddish pink peep and came back out the same on the other end. Ive had a colonoscopy and I was told I have internal hemorrhoids. But I didnt mention this. Im an idiot I know. I have an appointment in May and I promise Ill tell my doctor then. Unrelated but I was in a car accident recently. I go to college out of state so my parents came up to help me as I am injured. It happened again today (I highly doubt it is related to the accident as this has been happening for years). I want to finally tell them but Im afraid theyll think its related to the accident and freak out thinking Im dying and rush me to the er. I could email my doc as this is easier to admit over email rather than spoken word. But I am also afraid the doc will freak out and try to get me to go to the er. Do I wait til the appointment or what?", "Health Anxiety Experience: Body Pulling after waking up. I woke up this morning and immediately slammed into a wall. It feels like someone put bricks in the left side of my head and my overall balance is completely off when Im standing, sitting or laying down. The left side of my head is just super heavy and is affecting my walking. It just feels like my entire body is being pulled to the left constantly. Its been about 40 minutes and it is still occuring. Im super scared its MS or a Brain tumor because its ALL I can find when I look it up. Has anyone ever experienced this before?", "Health Anxiety Experience: mole on my back left my mind racing link to pic here-gt; [https:i.imgur.comhvj7FhW.jpg](https:i.imgur.comhvj7FhW.jpg) amp;x200B; I found this mole two days ago on my back, just behind my left armpit. I honestly dont know if its new or not. I measured it and it is 7-8 mm in length, 5 mm in width. amp;x200B; we have holiday in my country now from friday through monday so all the doctors offices will be open again on tuesday. never wished for a long weekend to be over so quick before lol.", "Health Anxiety Experience: another health scare so about an hour ago? i would say, i out of nowhere got this weird crampy kindof feeling on the left side behind my knee. its long gone, but now i have this weird kindof .. dull throbbing cramp like sensation (i dont know how to explain it) coming on and off above my knee on my thigh. of course, i went to google and discovered what a DVT was and am now terrified i have a blood clot forming. my leg isnt swelling, tender, or warm to the touch. i know this doesnt really have much to do with it, but im 16 years old and quite healthy. you think this is another thing im just freaking out over?", "Health Anxiety Experience: pregnancy scare i convinced myself i had gotten pregnant after not using a condom (even tho he pulled out) because my period was 3 weeks late. i truly thought the only way out of it was to kill myself, and i was mentally preparing to die for weeks without telling anyone else. turns out my period was just late. i need to chill."]
